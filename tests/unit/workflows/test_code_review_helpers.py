"""Educational Tests for Code Review Helper Functions

Learning Objectives:
- How to mock complex file system structures (multiple files)
- Testing multi-file reading with graceful degradation
- Context-based conditional logic testing
- Testing file existence checks and fallback behavior
- Integration testing across multiple helper methods

This test suite demonstrates progressive complexity:
- LESSON 1: Simple file existence checks
- LESSON 2: Multi-file context gathering
- LESSON 3: Graceful degradation when files are missing
- LESSON 4: Conditional stage skipping logic
- LESSON 5: Integration testing (combining multiple helpers)

# ============================================================================
# SUMMARY: What We Learned
# ============================================================================
"""
This test suite demonstrated 6 progressive lessons in testing:

1. **Basic File I/O Testing**
   - Using tmp_path fixture for isolated test environments
   - Testing empty directory behavior
   - Extracting metadata from environment

2. **Multi-File Context Gathering**
   - Building complex file structures in tests
   - Testing multiple file format detection (TOML, JSON, Markdown)
   - Priority ordering (README.md > README.rst > README.txt)

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Content truncation for large files
   - Error handling with try/except blocks
   - Continuing operation despite partial failures

4. **Directory Traversal & Filtering**
   - Testing directory structure generation
   - Exclusion patterns for common ignored directories
   - Depth limiting to prevent overwhelming output

5. **Conditional Business Logic**
   - Error propagation (skip stages after errors)
   - Cost optimization (skip premium models for simple changes)
   - State-based decision making

6. **Integration Testing**
   - Testing complete workflows end-to-end
   - Combining multiple helpers
   - Stateful behavior across stages

**Key Patterns Used:**
- `tmp_path` fixture for file system isolation
- `monkeypatch.chdir()` for changing working directory in tests
- Parametrized tests for testing multiple scenarios (could be added)
- State manipulation for testing conditional logic
- Realistic test data that mirrors production usage

**See Also:**
- Pattern Library: "File System Mocking Patterns" (Phase 5)
- Tutorial: "Testing Configuration Loading in Python" (Phase 1)
- Tutorial: "Integration Testing Best Practices" (Phase 3)
