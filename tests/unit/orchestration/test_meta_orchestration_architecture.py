"""Architectural Tests for Meta-Orchestration System.

This test suite validates architectural invariants and production readiness
of the meta-orchestration system (v4.0 flagship feature).

Coverage Target: 90%+ (from 22.53%)

Test Categories:
1. Task Analysis & Classification (deterministic behavior)
2. Agent Selection & Composition (correct agent matching)
3. Pattern Selection Logic (optimal strategy choice)
4. Quality Gates & Validation (threshold enforcement)
5. Cost & Duration Estimation (accurate predictions)
6. Learning Loop Integration (confidence updates)
7. Failure Handling & Recovery (graceful degradation)
8. Concurrent Task Handling (thread safety)

Architecture Invariants Tested:
- Task complexity classification is deterministic
- Agent selection matches required capabilities
- Composition patterns respect task characteristics
- Quality gates are enforced at each stage
- Failed compositions are logged and quarantined
- Resource limits are respected
- Pattern confidence updates after execution
