"""Security Validation Tests for Empathy Framework.

Tests security features including:
- Path traversal prevention
- Null byte injection prevention
- System directory protection
- File path validation
- Encryption functionality

These tests address critical security gaps identified in TEST_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
Phase 1: Security Validation Tests (CRITICAL severity).
