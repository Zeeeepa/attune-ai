Most AI tools are **reactive** - they wait for you to ask, then respond. Empathy is **anticipatory** - it predicts what you'll need and warns you before problems happen.

```bash
pip install empathy-framework
```

## What It Does

- **🔮 Predicts issues 30-90 days ahead** - Security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, compliance gaps
- **🧠 Learns patterns across domains** - Healthcare handoff protocols → deployment safety checks
- **🔌 Works with any LLM** - Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, local models via Ollama
- **🏥 Enterprise-ready** - PII scrubbing, audit logging, HIPAA/GDPR compliant
- **📦 2,000+ downloads** on PyPI, 2,040+ tests passing

## Quick Example

```python
from empathy_os import EmpathyOS

os = EmpathyOS()

# Analyze code for current AND future issues
result = await os.collaborate(
    "Review this deployment pipeline for problems",
    context={"code": pipeline_code, "team_size": 10}
)

# Get predictions, not just analysis
print(result.current_issues)      # What's wrong now
print(result.predicted_issues)    # What will break in 30-90 days
print(result.prevention_steps)    # How to prevent it
```

## The 5 Levels of AI Empathy

| Level | Name | Behavior | Example |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Reactive | Responds when asked | "Here's the data you requested" |
| 2 | Guided | Asks clarifying questions | "What format do you need?" |
| 3 | Proactive | Notices patterns | "I pre-fetched what you usually need" |
| **4** | **Anticipatory** | **Predicts future needs** | **"This query will timeout at 10k users"** |
| 5 | Transformative | Builds preventing structures | "Here's a framework for all future cases" |

**Empathy operates at Level 4** - predicting problems before they manifest.

## Install Options

```bash
# Basic
pip install empathy-framework

# With all features (recommended)
pip install empathy-framework[full]

# Development
git clone https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy.git
cd empathy && pip install -e .[dev]
```

## What's Included

- **30+ Wizards** - Security, performance, testing, accessibility, compliance
- **Healthcare Suite** - SBAR, SOAP notes, clinical protocols (HIPAA compliant)
- **IDE Plugins** - VS Code and JetBrains extensions (examples/)
- **Enterprise Security** - PII scrubbing, secrets detection, audit logging
- **Memory Control Panel** - CLI and API for managing Redis + pattern storage

## Memory Control Panel

Manage AI memory with a simple CLI:

```bash
# Start everything (Redis + API server)
empathy-memory serve

# Check system status
empathy-memory status

# View statistics
empathy-memory stats

# Run health check
empathy-memory health

# List stored patterns
empathy-memory patterns
```

The API server runs at `http://localhost:8765` with endpoints for status, stats, patterns, and Redis control.

**VS Code Extension:** A visual panel for monitoring memory is available in `vscode-memory-panel/`.
