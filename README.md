## What's New in v2.4.1

- **Security: macOS path validation bypass (CWE-22)** - Fixed `_validate_file_path()` in 5 modules where `/etc` -> `/private/etc` symlink bypassed system directory checks
- **Healthcare Domain Plugin** - Clinical decision support agents with FHIR resources, waveform analysis, audit logging, and SMART on FHIR auth
- **Redis pubsub thread leak fix** - `PubSubManager.close()` now joins listener threads, preventing daemon thread leaks
- **Rebranding to Attune AI** - Removed legacy "Empathy Framework" references, deleted wizard-based CLI
- **Windows CI stability** - Fixed timestamp collisions, encoding, case sensitivity, and PowerShell compatibility

## Key Features

### Claude-Native Architecture

Attune AI is built exclusively for Anthropic/Claude, unlocking features impossible with multi-provider abstraction:

- **Prompt Caching** - 90% cost reduction on repeated prompts
- **Flexible Context** - 200K via subscription, up to 1M via API for large codebases
- **Extended Thinking** - Access Claude's internal reasoning process
- **Advanced Tool Use** - Optimized for agentic workflows

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Full support for custom agents and Anthropic LLM agents:

- **Agent Teams** - Pre-built teams for release prep (4 agents) with extensible agent framework
- **Agent Coordination Dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with 6 coordination patterns
- **Progressive Tier Escalation** - Agents start cheap and escalate only when needed
- **Inter-Agent Communication** - Heartbeats, signals, events, and approval gates
- **Redis Production Patterns** - `scan_iter()` for safe key enumeration, pipeline batching, pub/sub reconnection with exponential backoff

### Modular Architecture

Clean, maintainable codebase built for extensibility:

- **Small, Focused Files** - No file exceeds 1,000 lines; logic extracted into mixins and utilities
- **Cross-Platform CI** - Tested on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows with Python 3.10-3.13
- **13,800+ Tests** - Security, unit, integration, and behavioral test coverage at 80%+ coverage

### Intelligent Cost Optimization

- **$0 in Claude Code** - Workflows run as skills through Claude's Task tool
- **Smart Tier Routing** - Automatically selects the right model for each task
- **Authentication Strategy** - Routes between subscription and API based on codebase size

### Socratic Workflows

Workflows guide you through discovery instead of requiring upfront configuration:

- **Interactive Discovery** - Asks targeted questions to understand your needs
- **Context Gathering** - Collects relevant code, errors, and constraints
- **Dynamic Agent Creation** - Assembles the right team based on your answers

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
pip install attune-ai
```

### 2. Setup Slash Commands

```bash
attune setup
```

This installs `/attune` to `~/.claude/commands/` for Claude Code.

### 3. Use in Claude Code

Just type:

```bash
/attune
```

Socratic discovery guides you to the right workflow.

**Or use shortcuts:**

```bash
/attune debug      # Debug an issue
/attune test       # Run tests
/attune security   # Security audit
/attune commit     # Create commit
/attune pr         # Create pull request
```

### CLI Usage

Run workflows directly from terminal:

```bash
attune workflow run release-prep           # 4-agent release readiness check
attune workflow run security-audit --path ./src
attune workflow run test-gen --path ./src
attune telemetry show
```

### Need all features?

```bash
pip install attune-ai[developer]
```

This adds multi-LLM support, agents, and memory features.

## Command Hubs

Workflows are organized into hubs for easy discovery:

| Hub               | Command       | Description                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Developer**     | `/dev`        | Debug, commit, PR, code review, quality      |
| **Testing**       | `/testing`    | Run tests, coverage analysis, benchmarks     |
| **Documentation** | `/docs`       | Generate and manage documentation            |
| **Release**       | `/release`    | Release prep, security scan, publishing      |
| **Workflows**     | `/workflows`  | Automated analysis (security, bugs, perf)    |
| **Plan**          | `/plan`       | Planning, TDD, code review, refactoring      |
| **Agent**         | `/agent`      | Create and manage custom agents              |

**Natural Language Routing:**

```bash
/workflows "find security vulnerabilities"  # → security-audit
/workflows "check code performance"         # → perf-audit
/plan "review my code"                      # → code-review
```

---

## Cost Optimization

### Skills = $0 (Claude Code)

When using Claude Code, workflows run as skills through the Task tool - **no API costs**:

```bash
/dev           # $0 - uses your Claude subscription
/testing       # $0
/release       # $0
```

### API Mode (CI/CD, Automation)

For programmatic use, smart tier routing saves 34-86%:

| Tier    | Model         | Use Case                     | Cost    |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| CHEAP   | Haiku         | Formatting, simple tasks     | ~$0.005 |
| CAPABLE | Sonnet        | Bug fixes, code review       | ~$0.08  |
| PREMIUM | Opus          | Architecture, complex design | ~$0.45  |

```bash
# Track API usage and savings
attune telemetry savings --days 30
```

---

## MCP Server Integration

Attune AI includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes all workflows as native Claude Code tools:

- **10 Tools Available** - security_audit, bug_predict, code_review, test_generation, performance_audit, release_prep, and more
- **Automatic Discovery** - Claude Code finds tools via `.claude/mcp.json`
- **Natural Language Access** - Describe your need and Claude invokes the appropriate tool

```bash
# Verify MCP integration
echo '{"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | PYTHONPATH=./src python -m attune.mcp.server
```

---

## Agent Coordination Dashboard

Real-time monitoring with 6 coordination patterns:

- Agent heartbeats and status tracking
- Inter-agent coordination signals
- Event streaming across agent workflows
- Approval gates for human-in-the-loop
- Quality feedback and performance metrics
- Demo mode with test data generation

```bash
# Launch dashboard (requires Redis 7.x or 8.x)
python examples/dashboard_demo.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

**Redis 8.4 Support:** Full compatibility with RediSearch, RedisJSON, RedisTimeSeries, RedisBloom, and VectorSet modules.

---

## Authentication Strategy

Intelligent routing between Claude subscription and Anthropic API:

```bash
# Interactive setup
python -m attune.models.auth_cli setup

# View current configuration
python -m attune.models.auth_cli status

# Get recommendation for a file
python -m attune.models.auth_cli recommend src/module.py
```

**Automatic routing:**

- Small/medium modules (<2000 LOC) → Claude subscription (free)
- Large modules (>2000 LOC) → Anthropic API (pay for what you need)

---

```bash
# Base install (CLI + workflows)
pip install attune-ai

## Environment Setup

**In Claude Code:** No setup needed - uses your Claude subscription.

**For CLI/API usage:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."  # Required for CLI workflows
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"  # Optional: for memory features
```

---

## Security

- Path traversal protection on all file operations (`_validate_file_path()` on 22 write operations)
- JWT authentication with rate limiting
- PII scrubbing in telemetry
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance options
- Automated security scanning (517 findings remediated to 0 across codebase)

```bash
# Run security audit
attune workflow run security-audit --path ./src
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.
