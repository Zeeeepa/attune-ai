## Meta-Workflow System 🤖 (v4.2+)

### **Intelligent Workflow Orchestration Through Forms + Dynamic Agents**

**The breakthrough:** The meta-workflow system combines Socratic forms (interactive questions), dynamic agent team creation, and pattern learning for self-improving workflows.

**How it works:**

1. 🎯 **Template Selection** - Choose from pre-built workflow templates (e.g., `python_package_publish`)
2. 📝 **Socratic Forms** - Answer interactive questions about your workflow requirements
3. 🤖 **Dynamic Agent Creation** - System generates optimized agent team based on your responses
4. ⚡ **Progressive Execution** - Agents execute with tier escalation (cheap → capable → premium)
5. 🧠 **Pattern Learning** - System learns from outcomes to optimize future workflows

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Run meta-workflow with interactive form
empathy meta-workflow run python_package_publish

# View pattern learning insights
empathy meta-workflow analytics python_package_publish

# List historical executions
empathy meta-workflow list-runs
```

**Example workflow:**

```python
from empathy_os.meta_workflows import TemplateRegistry, MetaWorkflow, FormResponse

# Load template
registry = TemplateRegistry()
template = registry.load_template("python_package_publish")

# Create workflow
workflow = MetaWorkflow(template=template)

# Execute with form responses
response = FormResponse(
    template_id="python_package_publish",
    responses={
        "has_tests": "Yes",
        "test_coverage_required": "90%",
        "quality_checks": ["Linting (ruff)", "Type checking (mypy)"],
        "version_bump": "minor",
    },
)
result = workflow.execute(form_response=response, mock_execution=True)

print(f"✅ Created {len(result.agents_created)} agents")
print(f"💰 Total cost: ${result.total_cost:.2f}")
```

**Key Features:**

- ✅ **Interactive forms** via `AskUserQuestion` (batched, max 4 at a time)
- ✅ **Dynamic agent generation** from templates based on responses
- ✅ **Hybrid storage** - files (persistent) + memory (semantic queries)
- ✅ **Pattern learning** - analyzes historical executions for optimization

## What's in v4.0.0 🎭 **META-ORCHESTRATION**

### **AI Agents That Compose Themselves**

**The concept:** Instead of manually wiring agent workflows, v4.0 introduces a meta-orchestration system that analyzes tasks, selects optimal agent teams, chooses composition patterns, and learns from outcomes.

**What this means:**

- 🧠 **Automatic task analysis** → Determines complexity, domain, required capabilities
- 🤝 **Dynamic team composition** → Selects optimal agents from 7 pre-built templates
- 📐 **Intelligent strategy selection** → Chooses from 6 composition patterns (Sequential, Parallel, Debate, Teaching, Refinement, Adaptive)
- 📚 **Self-learning** → Saves successful compositions and improves over time
- ⚡ **Production-ready workflows** → Release Prep (parallel validation), Test Coverage Boost (sequential improvement)

### Quick Start

**Release preparation with 4 parallel agents:**

```bash
empathy orchestrate release-prep
```

Automatically runs:

- **Security Auditor** (vulnerability scan)
- **Test Coverage Analyzer** (gap analysis)
- **Code Quality Reviewer** (best practices)
- **Documentation Writer** (completeness check)

**Boost test coverage to 90%:**

```bash
empathy orchestrate test-coverage --target 90
```

Sequential workflow:

1. **Coverage Analyzer** → Identify gaps
2. **Test Generator** → Create tests
3. **Test Validator** → Verify coverage

### Python API

```python
from empathy_os.workflows.orchestrated_release_prep import (
    OrchestratedReleasePrepWorkflow
)

# Create workflow with custom quality gates
workflow = OrchestratedReleasePrepWorkflow(
    quality_gates={
        "min_coverage": 90.0,
        "max_critical_issues": 0,
    }
)

# Execute
report = await workflow.execute(path=".")

if report.approved:
    print(f"✅ Release approved! (confidence: {report.confidence})")
else:
    for blocker in report.blockers:
        print(f"❌ {blocker}")
```

### 6 Composition Patterns

The meta-orchestrator automatically selects the best pattern:

1. **Sequential** (A → B → C) - Pipeline processing
2. **Parallel** (A ‖ B ‖ C) - Independent validation
3. **Debate** (A ⇄ B ⇄ C → Synthesis) - Consensus building
4. **Teaching** (Junior → Expert) - Cost optimization
5. **Refinement** (Draft → Review → Polish) - Iterative improvement
6. **Adaptive** (Classifier → Specialist) - Right-sizing

### Learning System

Successful compositions are saved and improved over time:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.config_store import ConfigurationStore

store = ConfigurationStore()

# Find best composition for task
best = store.get_best_for_task("release_prep")
print(f"Success rate: {best.success_rate:.1%}")

# Reuse proven composition
agents = [get_template(a["role"]) for a in best.agents]
```

- ✅ **Quality gates enforcement** with detailed reporting
- ✅ **Configuration store** learns from outcomes
- ✅ **Cost optimization** via tier selection (CHEAP → CAPABLE → PREMIUM)

```

- **Tag compression**: `<thinking>` → `<t>`, `<answer>` → `<a>` (15+ common tags)
- **Whitespace optimization**: Removes excess whitespace while preserving structure
- **Redundancy elimination**: Strips "Please note that", "Make sure to", etc.
- **Real-world impact**: Integration tests achieved **49.7% reduction** on typical prompts
- **Bidirectional**: Full decompression to restore original tag names

#### XML Validation — **Never Crash on Malformed Responses Again**

```python
from empathy_os.validation import validate_xml_response

result = validate_xml_response(llm_response)
if result.is_valid:
    data = result.parsed_data
else:
    # Fallback extraction worked - you still get partial data
    data = result.parsed_data or {}
```

- **Graceful fallback parsing**: Regex extraction when XML is malformed
- **Optional XSD validation**: Full schema validation with lxml
- **Schema caching**: Performance optimization for repeated validations

## What's New in v3.6.0

### 💡 **Finally! Error Messages That Actually Help You**

**No more cryptic `NotImplementedError` when extending the framework!**

We completely rewrote error messages across **5 base classes**. Now when you're building plugins or extensions, you get:

✅ **Exactly which method** you need to implement
✅ **Which base class** to extend
✅ **Real working examples** from the codebase to copy
✅ **Clear explanations** of what each method should return

**Before** (frustrating 😤):

```python
NotImplementedError
# ...now what? Time to dig through source code for 30 minutes
```

**After** (helpful 🎯):

```python
NotImplementedError: BaseLinterParser.parse() must be implemented.
Create a subclass of BaseLinterParser and implement the parse() method.
See ESLintParser, PylintParser, or MyPyParser for examples.
# Perfect! Now I know exactly what to do
```

#### Plus: 9 Integration TODOs Now Link to Working Code

- **Want to add compliance tracking?** → See `ComplianceDatabase` class (agents/compliance_db.py)
- **Need multi-channel notifications?** → See `NotificationService` class (agents/notifications.py)
- **Wondering about MemDocs integration?** → We documented why local cache works better (with rationale)
- **Need secure document storage?** → S3/Azure/SharePoint recommendations with HIPAA requirements

**Impact**: Onboard new contributors in **minutes instead of hours**. Build your first plugin in **one sitting**.

## What's New in v3.8.0

### 🚀 **Intelligent Response Caching: Benchmarked Performance**

**Stop paying full price for repeated LLM calls. Measured results: up to 99.8% faster, 40% cost reduction on test generation, 57% cache hit rate on security audits.**

#### Hybrid Cache: Hash + Semantic Matching

```python
from empathy_os.workflows import SecurityAuditWorkflow

# That's it - caching auto-configured!
workflow = SecurityAuditWorkflow(enable_cache=True)
result = await workflow.execute(target_path="./src")

# Check savings
print(f"Cost: ${result.cost_report.total_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Cache hit rate: {result.cost_report.cache_hit_rate:.1f}%")
print(f"Savings: ${result.cost_report.savings_from_cache:.4f}")
```

**Real Results** (v3.8.0 benchmark - see [CACHING_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md](CACHING_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md)):

- **Hash-only cache**: 30.3% average hit rate across 12 workflows, up to 99.8% faster (code review: 17.8s → 0.03s)
- **Hybrid cache**: Up to 57% hit rate on similar prompts (security audit - benchmarked)
- **Cost reduction**: 40% on test-generation workflow (measured)

#### Two Cache Strategies

**Hash-Only Cache** (Default - Zero Dependencies):
- Perfect for CI/CD and testing
- 100% hit rate on identical prompts
- ~5μs lookup time
- No ML dependencies needed

**Hybrid Cache** (Semantic Matching):

- Up to 57% hit rate on similar prompts (benchmarked)
- Understands intent, not just text
- Install: `pip install empathy-framework[cache]`
- Best for development and production

#### Automatic Setup

Framework detects your environment and configures optimal caching:

```python
# First run: Framework checks for sentence-transformers
# - Found? Uses hybrid cache (semantic matching, up to 57% hit rate)
# - Missing? Prompts: "Install for semantic matching? (y/n)"
# - Declined? Falls back to hash-only (100% hit rate on identical prompts)
# - Any errors? Disables gracefully, workflow continues

# Subsequent runs: Cache just works
```

#### The Caching Paradox: Adaptive Workflows

**Discovered during v3.8.0 development**: Some workflows (Security Audit, Bug Prediction) cost MORE on Run 2 with cache enabled - and that's a FEATURE.

**Why?** Adaptive workflows use cache to free up time for deeper analysis:

```
Security Audit without cache:
Run 1: $0.11, 45 seconds - surface scan finds 3 issues

Security Audit with cache:
Run 2: $0.13, 15 seconds - cache frees 30s for deep analysis
       → Uses saved time for PREMIUM tier vulnerability research
       → Finds 7 issues including critical SQLi we missed
       → Extra $0.02 cost = prevented security breach
```

**Result**: Cache makes workflows SMARTER, not just cheaper.

## XML-Enhanced Prompts

Enable structured XML prompts for consistent, parseable LLM responses:

```yaml
# .empathy/workflows.yaml
xml_prompt_defaults:
  enabled: false  # Set true to enable globally

workflow_xml_configs:
  security-audit:
    enabled: true
    enforce_response_xml: true
    template_name: "security-audit"
  code-review:
    enabled: true
    template_name: "code-review"
```

Built-in templates: `security-audit`, `code-review`, `research`, `bug-analysis`, `perf-audit`, `refactor-plan`, `test-gen`, `doc-gen`, `release-prep`, `dependency-check`

```python
from empathy_os.prompts import get_template, XmlResponseParser, PromptContext

# Use a built-in template
template = get_template("security-audit")
context = PromptContext.for_security_audit(code="def foo(): pass")
prompt = template.render(context)

# Parse XML responses
parser = XmlResponseParser(fallback_on_error=True)
result = parser.parse(llm_response)
print(result.summary, result.findings, result.checklist)
```

---

## Enterprise Doc-Gen

Generate comprehensive documentation for large projects with enterprise-safe defaults:

```python
from empathy_os.workflows import DocumentGenerationWorkflow

# Enterprise-safe configuration
workflow = DocumentGenerationWorkflow(
    export_path="docs/generated",     # Auto-save to disk
    max_cost=5.0,                     # Cost guardrail ($5 default)
    chunked_generation=True,          # Handle large projects
    graceful_degradation=True,        # Partial results on errors
)

result = await workflow.execute(
    source_code=your_code,
    doc_type="api_reference",
    audience="developers"
)

# Access the formatted report
print(result.final_output["formatted_report"])

# Large outputs are chunked for display
if "output_chunks" in result.final_output:
    for chunk in result.final_output["output_chunks"]:
        print(chunk)

# Full docs saved to disk
print(f"Saved to: {result.final_output.get('export_path')}")
```

---

## Smart Router

Route natural language requests to the right wizard automatically:

```python
from empathy_os.routing import SmartRouter

router = SmartRouter()

# Natural language routing
decision = router.route_sync("Fix the security vulnerability in auth.py")
print(f"Primary: {decision.primary_wizard}")      # → security-audit
print(f"Also consider: {decision.secondary_wizards}")  # → [code-review]
print(f"Confidence: {decision.confidence}")

# File-based suggestions
suggestions = router.suggest_for_file("requirements.txt")  # → [dependency-check]

# Error-based suggestions
suggestions = router.suggest_for_error("NullReferenceException")  # → [bug-predict, test-gen]
```

---

## Memory Graph

Cross-wizard knowledge sharing - wizards learn from each other:

```python
from empathy_os.memory import MemoryGraph, EdgeType

graph = MemoryGraph()

# Add findings from any wizard
bug_id = graph.add_finding(
    wizard="bug-predict",
    finding={
        "type": "bug",
        "name": "Null reference in auth.py:42",
        "severity": "high"
    }
)

# Connect related findings
fix_id = graph.add_finding(wizard="code-review", finding={"type": "fix", "name": "Add null check"})
graph.add_edge(bug_id, fix_id, EdgeType.FIXED_BY)

# Find similar past issues
similar = graph.find_similar({"name": "Null reference error"})

# Traverse relationships
related_fixes = graph.find_related(bug_id, edge_types=[EdgeType.FIXED_BY])
```

---

## Auto-Chaining

Wizards automatically trigger related wizards based on findings:

```yaml
# .empathy/wizard_chains.yaml
chains:
  security-audit:
    auto_chain: true
    triggers:
      - condition: "high_severity_count > 0"
        next: dependency-check
        approval_required: false
      - condition: "vulnerability_type == 'injection'"
        next: code-review
        approval_required: true

  bug-predict:
    triggers:
      - condition: "risk_score > 0.7"
        next: test-gen

templates:
  full-security-review:
    steps: [security-audit, dependency-check, code-review]
  pre-release:
    steps: [test-gen, security-audit, release-prep]
```

```python
from empathy_os.routing import ChainExecutor

executor = ChainExecutor()

# Check what chains would trigger
result = {"high_severity_count": 5}
triggers = executor.get_triggered_chains("security-audit", result)
# → [ChainTrigger(next="dependency-check"), ...]

# Execute a template
template = executor.get_template("full-security-review")
# → ["security-audit", "dependency-check", "code-review"]
```

---

## Prompt Engineering Wizard

Analyze, generate, and optimize prompts:

```python
from coach_wizards import PromptEngineeringWizard

wizard = PromptEngineeringWizard()

# Analyze existing prompts
analysis = wizard.analyze_prompt("Fix this bug")
print(f"Score: {analysis.overall_score}")  # → 0.13 (poor)
print(f"Issues: {analysis.issues}")        # → ["Missing role", "No output format"]

# Generate optimized prompts
prompt = wizard.generate_prompt(
    task="Review code for security vulnerabilities",
    role="a senior security engineer",
    constraints=["Focus on OWASP top 10"],
    output_format="JSON with severity and recommendation"
)

# Optimize tokens (reduce costs)
result = wizard.optimize_tokens(verbose_prompt)
print(f"Reduced: {result.token_reduction:.0%}")  # → 20% reduction

# Add chain-of-thought scaffolding
enhanced = wizard.add_chain_of_thought(prompt, "debug")
```

## The 5 Levels of AI Empathy

| Level | Name | Behavior | Example |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Reactive | Responds when asked | "Here's the data you requested" |
| 2 | Guided | Asks clarifying questions | "What format do you need?" |
| 3 | Proactive | Notices patterns | "I pre-fetched what you usually need" |
| **4** | **Anticipatory** | **Predicts future needs** | **"This query will timeout at 10k users"** |
| 5 | Transformative | Builds preventing structures | "Here's a framework for all future cases" |

**Empathy operates at Level 4** — predicting problems before they manifest.
