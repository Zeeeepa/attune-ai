"""Code Inspection Agent Pipeline

Multi-agent orchestrated code inspection with parallel execution,
cross-tool intelligence, and pattern learning.

Usage:
    from agents.code_inspection import CodeInspectionAgent, run_inspection

    # Simple usage
    state = await run_inspection("./src")
    print(f"Health Score: {state['overall_health_score']}/100")

    # Advanced usage
    agent = CodeInspectionAgent(
        parallel_mode=True,
        learning_enabled=True
    )
    state = await agent.inspect(
        project_path="./src",
        target_mode="staged"
    )
    print(agent.format_report(state))
