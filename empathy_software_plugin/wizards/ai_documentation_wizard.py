"""
AI-First Documentation Wizard - Level 4 Anticipatory Empathy

Alerts developers when documentation patterns will limit AI effectiveness.

In our experience, documentation written for humans often confuses AI.
This wizard learned to predict when documentation gaps will cause AI
to give poor recommendations, before developers waste time debugging why.

    When we started using AI coding assistants heavily, we discovered our

    made perfect sense to us confused AI. Missing context that humans inferred
    caused AI to make wrong assumptions.
