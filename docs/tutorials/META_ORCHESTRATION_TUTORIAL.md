> **📘 About This Tutorial**
>
> This tutorial uses **software development agents** as examples (security auditing, test coverage, code quality), since the framework is primarily used by developers. However, **meta-orchestration is domain-agnostic** and works with any type of agent.
>
> The Empathy Framework also includes:
>
> - **Healthcare-specific agents**: HIPAA compliance, patient data validation, clinical workflows
> - **Code analysis tools**: Static analysis, SARIF reports, architectural insights
>
> The meta-orchestration system can compose teams from *any* domain. The principles you learn here apply universally.

## <a name="the-big-idea"></a>🧠 The Big Idea: From Static to Dynamic

### The Problem with Traditional Workflows

In traditional AI systems, you manually wire together agents:

```python
# Traditional approach: Manual wiring
security_agent = SecurityAgent()
test_agent = TestAgent()
quality_agent = QualityAgent()

# You decide the execution order
security_results = security_agent.run()
test_results = test_agent.run()
quality_results = quality_agent.run()

# You manually combine results
combined = combine_results([security_results, test_results, quality_results])
```

**Problems:**
- 🔧 **Rigid**: Can't adapt to different tasks
- 📈 **Doesn't scale**: Each new task requires manual wiring
- 🧠 **No learning**: Doesn't improve over time
- 💰 **Inefficient**: Always uses the same agents regardless of task complexity

### The Meta-Orchestration Solution

With meta-orchestration, you describe **what you want**, and the system figures out **how to do it**:

```python
# Meta-orchestration approach: Declarative
from empathy_os.orchestration import MetaOrchestrator

orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()

# Just describe the task
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Prepare for production release",
    context={"project_path": "."}
)

# System automatically:
# 1. Analyzes task complexity and domain
# 2. Selects optimal agents (security, testing, quality, docs)
# 3. Chooses best composition pattern (parallel for speed)
# 4. Estimates cost and duration
# 5. Executes with quality gates
```

**Benefits:**
- ✨ **Adaptive**: Different tasks get different agent teams
- 📊 **Intelligent**: Chooses optimal composition patterns
- 🎯 **Cost-aware**: Uses cheaper agents when appropriate
- 📚 **Self-learning**: Improves from past successes

## <a name="quick-start"></a>🚀 Quick Start: Your First Orchestrated Workflow

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install empathy-framework[developer]==4.0.0
```

### Example 1: Release Preparation (5 minutes)

The **Release Prep** workflow runs 4 validation agents in parallel:

```bash
# Basic usage
empathy orchestrate release-prep

# With custom quality gates
empathy orchestrate release-prep \
    --min-coverage 90 \
    --min-quality 8 \
    --max-critical 0

# JSON output for CI/CD
empathy orchestrate release-prep --json > report.json
```

**What happens:**
1. ✅ **Security Auditor** scans for vulnerabilities
2. ✅ **Test Coverage Analyzer** identifies testing gaps
3. ✅ **Code Quality Reviewer** checks best practices
4. ✅ **Documentation Writer** verifies completeness

All run **in parallel** for speed! ⚡

**Sample output:**

```
============================================================
  RELEASE PREPARATION REPORT
============================================================

  ✓ Security Auditor: No critical issues
  ✓ Test Coverage: 87.5% (target: 80%)
  ✓ Code Quality: 8.2/10 (target: 7.0)
  ⚠ Documentation: 95% (target: 100%)

  🎯 QUALITY GATES
  --------------------------------------------------------
  ✅ All critical gates passed!
  ⚠  1 warning (documentation below 100%)

  ✅ RELEASE APPROVED (confidence: medium)

  Duration: 2.3 seconds
============================================================
```

### Example 2: Test Coverage Boost (10 minutes)

The **Test Coverage Boost** workflow improves test coverage in 3 sequential stages:

```bash
# Basic usage
empathy orchestrate test-coverage

# Set target coverage
empathy orchestrate test-coverage --target 90

# Specify project root
empathy orchestrate test-coverage \
    --project-root ./my-project \
    --target 85
```

**What happens:**
1. 🔍 **Stage 1: Analysis** - Identifies gaps by importance
2. 🔨 **Stage 2: Generation** - Creates tests for high-priority gaps
3. ✅ **Stage 3: Validation** - Verifies tests pass and coverage improves

**Sample output:**

```
============================================================
  TEST COVERAGE BOOST
============================================================

  Target Coverage: 90.0%
  Current Coverage: 75.0%

  🔍 Stage 1: Coverage Gap Analysis
  ✓ Identified 12 high-priority gaps
  ✓ Found 8 untested edge cases

  🔨 Stage 2: Test Generation
  ✓ Generated 23 tests
  ✓ Expected coverage increase: +15%

  ✅ Stage 3: Test Validation
  ✓ All tests pass
  ✓ Final coverage: 90.2%
  ✓ Improvement: +15.2%

  🎯 SUCCESS: Coverage target achieved!

  Duration: 8.7 seconds
============================================================
```

### Example 3: Health Check (2 minutes)

The **Health Check** workflow provides adaptive health assessment with 3 modes:

```bash
# Quick daily check (3 agents in parallel)
empathy orchestrate health-check --mode daily

# Comprehensive weekly (5 agents)
empathy orchestrate health-check --mode weekly

# Pre-release deep dive (6 agents)
empathy orchestrate health-check --mode release

# JSON output for dashboards
empathy orchestrate health-check --mode daily --json
```

**What happens:**

- **Daily**: Security, Coverage, Quality (fast parallel check)
- **Weekly**: Adds Performance, Documentation (comprehensive)
- **Release**: Adds Architecture analysis (deep refinement)

**Sample output:**

```text
============================================================
  🏥 HEALTH CHECK REPORT
============================================================

  Health Score: 85/100 (Grade: B)
  Trend: Improving (+5 from last week)
  Duration: 1.2s

  ⚠️  Issues Found (1):
    • Documentation below 100% (92%)

  💡 Recommendations:
    1. 📚 Complete API documentation for 3 modules
    2. ✅ Maintain current test coverage (excellent!)

============================================================
```

## <a name="understanding-agent-templates"></a>🤖 Understanding Agent Templates

Agent templates are **reusable archetypes** with specific capabilities. Think of them as specialized experts you can call upon.

### The 7 Built-in Templates

| Template | Tier | Role | Capabilities |
|----------|------|------|--------------|
| **test_coverage_analyzer** | CAPABLE | Test Coverage Expert | analyze_gaps, suggest_tests, validate_coverage |
| **security_auditor** | PREMIUM | Security Auditor | vulnerability_scan, threat_modeling, compliance_check |
| **code_reviewer** | CAPABLE | Code Quality Reviewer | code_review, quality_assessment, best_practices_check |
| **documentation_writer** | CHEAP | Documentation Writer | generate_docs, check_completeness, update_examples |
| **performance_optimizer** | CAPABLE | Performance Optimizer | profile_code, identify_bottlenecks, suggest_optimizations |
| **architecture_analyst** | PREMIUM | Architecture Analyst | analyze_architecture, identify_patterns, suggest_improvements |
| **refactoring_specialist** | CAPABLE | Refactoring Specialist | identify_code_smells, suggest_refactorings, validate_changes |

### Exploring Templates (Python)

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration import get_all_templates, get_template

# List all templates
templates = get_all_templates()
for t in templates:
    print(f"{t.id}: {t.role} ({t.tier_preference})")

# Get specific template
security_template = get_template("security_auditor")
print(f"Role: {security_template.role}")
print(f"Capabilities: {security_template.capabilities}")
print(f"Tools: {security_template.tools}")
```

### Tier System: Cost vs. Capability

- **CHEAP**: Fast, inexpensive (e.g., documentation_writer)
- **CAPABLE**: Balanced performance/cost (e.g., test_coverage_analyzer)
- **PREMIUM**: Highest quality, most expensive (e.g., security_auditor)

The orchestrator **automatically selects tiers** based on task complexity!

## <a name="composition-patterns"></a>📐 The Six Composition Patterns

Meta-orchestration provides six **"grammar rules"** for combining agents:

### 1. Sequential (A → B → C)

**When to use:** Pipeline processing where each stage builds on previous results

**Example:** Test coverage boost (Analyze → Generate → Validate)

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import SequentialStrategy

strategy = SequentialStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute(agents, context)

# Stage 1 output feeds into Stage 2
# Stage 2 output feeds into Stage 3
```

**Characteristics:**
- ⏱️ Duration: Sum of all stages
- 🔄 Context passing between stages
- 📊 Best for: Iterative improvement, multi-stage pipelines

### 2. Parallel (A ‖ B ‖ C)

**When to use:** Independent validations that can run simultaneously

**Example:** Release prep (Security ‖ Coverage ‖ Quality ‖ Docs)

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import ParallelStrategy

strategy = ParallelStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute(agents, context)

# All agents run at the same time
# Results aggregated at the end
```

**Characteristics:**
- ⚡ Duration: Max of all agents (fastest!)
- 🎯 Best for: Independent checks, validation workflows
- 💰 Slightly higher cost (all agents run)

### 3. Debate (A ⇄ B ⇄ C → Synthesis)

**When to use:** Need consensus or multiple perspectives

**Example:** Architecture decisions, design reviews

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import DebateStrategy

strategy = DebateStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute(agents, context)

# Agents propose independent solutions
# Synthesis agent reconciles differences
```

**Characteristics:**
- 🤔 Duration: Multiple rounds + synthesis
- 🎯 Best for: Subjective decisions, architecture choices
- 💰 Higher cost (multiple agents + synthesis)

### 4. Teaching (Junior → Expert)

**When to use:** Cost optimization with quality gate fallback

**Example:** Documentation (cheap agent tries, expert validates)

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import TeachingStrategy

strategy = TeachingStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute([junior_agent, expert_agent], context)

# Junior attempts task (cheap)
# If quality score < threshold, expert takes over
```

**Characteristics:**
- 💰 Cost: Low if junior succeeds, medium if expert needed
- 🎯 Best for: Tasks where cheaper agents often succeed
- ⚖️ Balances cost and quality

### 5. Refinement (Draft → Review → Polish)

**When to use:** Progressive quality improvement

**Example:** Documentation refinement, code polishing

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import RefinementStrategy

strategy = RefinementStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute(agents, context)

# Draft stage (fast, rough)
# Review stage (checks quality)
# Polish stage (final touches)
```

**Characteristics:**
- 📈 Duration: Progressive (each stage improves previous)
- 🎯 Best for: Content creation, iterative improvement
- ✨ Each stage increases quality score

### 6. Adaptive (Classifier → Specialist)

**When to use:** Right-sizing based on task complexity

**Example:** Bug fixes (simple bugs get cheap agent, complex get expert)

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import AdaptiveStrategy

strategy = AdaptiveStrategy()
result = await strategy.execute(agents, context)

# Classifier determines complexity
# Routes to appropriate specialist
```

**Characteristics:**
- 🎯 Cost: Depends on task complexity
- 🧠 Best for: Variable complexity tasks
- 📊 Optimizes cost/quality tradeoff

## <a name="building-custom-workflows"></a>🛠️ Building Custom Workflows

### Example: Custom Security Deep Dive

Let's build a workflow that uses **Debate** pattern for security analysis:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration import MetaOrchestrator, get_template
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import DebateStrategy

class SecurityDeepDiveWorkflow:
    """Multi-perspective security analysis with debate."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()

    async def execute(self, project_path: str):
        # Compose security-focused agent team
        plan = self.orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
            task="Comprehensive security audit with multiple perspectives",
            context={
                "project_path": project_path,
                "domain": "security",
                "capabilities": ["vulnerability_scan", "threat_modeling"]
            }
        )

        # Override with Debate strategy for consensus
        strategy = DebateStrategy()
        result = await strategy.execute(plan.agents, {
            "project_path": project_path
        })

        # Process results
        if result.success:
            print(f"✅ Security audit complete")
            print(f"Consensus: {result.final_output.get('consensus')}")
            print(f"Confidence: {result.final_output.get('confidence')}")

        return result

# Usage
workflow = SecurityDeepDiveWorkflow()
result = await workflow.execute("./my-project")
```

### Example: Cost-Optimized Documentation

Using **Teaching** pattern to minimize costs:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration import get_template
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import TeachingStrategy

class CostOptimizedDocWorkflow:
    """Documentation with cost optimization."""

    async def execute(self, module_path: str):
        # Get cheap and capable agents
        junior = get_template("documentation_writer")  # CHEAP
        expert = get_template("code_reviewer")  # CAPABLE

        # Teaching strategy: junior tries, expert validates
        strategy = TeachingStrategy()
        result = await strategy.execute(
            agents=[junior, expert],
            context={
                "module_path": module_path,
                "quality_threshold": 7.0  # Expert takes over if < 7
            }
        )

        # Check which agent completed the task
        if result.final_output.get("completed_by") == junior.id:
            print(f"💰 Cost-optimized: Junior completed successfully")
        else:
            print(f"🎓 Quality-optimized: Expert took over")

        return result
```

### Example: Progressive Content Refinement

Using **Refinement** pattern for iterative improvement:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.execution_strategies import RefinementStrategy

class ContentRefinementWorkflow:
    """Progressive quality improvement for content."""

    async def execute(self, content: str):
        # Get agents for each refinement stage
        drafter = get_template("documentation_writer")
        reviewer = get_template("code_reviewer")
        polisher = get_template("documentation_writer")  # Reuse

        strategy = RefinementStrategy()
        result = await strategy.execute(
            agents=[drafter, reviewer, polisher],
            context={
                "content": content,
                "target_quality": 9.0  # High quality target
            }
        )

        # Show quality progression
        print(f"Draft quality: {result.outputs[0].quality_score}")
        print(f"Review quality: {result.outputs[1].quality_score}")
        print(f"Final quality: {result.outputs[2].quality_score}")

        return result
```

## <a name="learning-loop"></a>📚 The Learning Loop: How the System Improves

### How Configuration Store Works

The system **saves successful compositions** and **reuses them** for similar tasks:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.config_store import ConfigurationStore
from empathy_os.pattern_library import PatternLibrary

# Initialize store
store = ConfigurationStore(pattern_library=PatternLibrary())

# After successful workflow execution
config = AgentConfiguration(
    id="release_prep_001",
    task_pattern="release_preparation",
    agents=[
        {"role": "security_auditor", "tier": "PREMIUM"},
        {"role": "test_coverage_analyzer", "tier": "CAPABLE"}
    ],
    strategy="parallel",
    quality_gates={"min_coverage": 80}
)

# Save configuration
store.save(config)

# Record outcome
config.record_outcome(success=True, quality_score=87.5)
store.save(config)  # Update metrics
```

### Querying Learned Compositions

```python
# Find best composition for a task
best = store.get_best_for_task("release_preparation")
print(f"Success rate: {best.success_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Avg quality: {best.avg_quality_score:.1f}")
print(f"Usage count: {best.usage_count}")

# Search with filters
proven_configs = store.search(
    task_pattern="release_preparation",
    min_success_rate=0.8,
    min_quality_score=75.0
)

# Reuse proven composition
for config in proven_configs:
    print(f"  {config.id}: {config.success_rate:.1%} success")
```

### Pattern Library Integration

After **3+ successful uses** with **70%+ success rate**, compositions are contributed to the Pattern Library:

```python
# Automatic contribution after thresholds met
if config.usage_count >= 3 and config.success_rate >= 0.7:
    store.pattern_library.contribute_successful_composition(config)
    print(f"✅ Configuration promoted to pattern library!")
```

**Benefits:**
- 📊 Cross-project learning
- 🎯 Team knowledge sharing
- 📈 Continuous improvement

---

## <a name="advanced-techniques"></a>🎓 Advanced Techniques

### 1. Dynamic Agent Selection

Let the orchestrator choose agents based on task analysis:

```python
orchestrator = MetaOrchestrator()

# Orchestrator analyzes task and picks agents automatically
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Improve performance of slow API endpoint",
    context={"domain": "performance"}
)

print(f"Selected agents: {[a.role for a in plan.agents]}")
print(f"Strategy: {plan.strategy.value}")
print(f"Estimated cost: ${plan.estimated_cost:.2f}")
```

### 2. Hybrid Strategies

Combine multiple strategies in one workflow:

```python
class HybridWorkflow:
    """Combines parallel validation + sequential refinement."""

    async def execute(self, project_path: str):
        # Phase 1: Parallel validation
        validators = [
            get_template("security_auditor"),
            get_template("test_coverage_analyzer"),
            get_template("code_reviewer")
        ]

        parallel_strategy = ParallelStrategy()
        validation_results = await parallel_strategy.execute(
            validators,
            {"path": project_path}
        )

        # Phase 2: Sequential refinement if issues found
        if validation_results.has_issues():
            refiners = [
                get_template("refactoring_specialist"),
                get_template("code_reviewer")
            ]

            sequential_strategy = SequentialStrategy()
            refinement_results = await sequential_strategy.execute(
                refiners,
                {"issues": validation_results.issues}
            )

        return validation_results, refinement_results
```

### 3. Custom Agent Templates

Create your own specialized agents:

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.agent_templates import (
    AgentTemplate,
    AgentCapability,
    ResourceRequirements
)

# Define custom template
api_optimizer = AgentTemplate(
    id="api_optimizer",
    role="API Performance Optimizer",
    capabilities=[
        AgentCapability(
            name="profile_api",
            description="Profile API endpoint performance",
            required_context=["endpoint_url"],
            output_schema={"response_time": "float", "bottlenecks": "list"}
        ),
        AgentCapability(
            name="optimize_queries",
            description="Optimize database queries",
            required_context=["db_connection"],
            output_schema={"queries_optimized": "int", "improvement": "float"}
        )
    ],
    tier_preference="CAPABLE",
    resource_requirements=ResourceRequirements(
        max_tokens=8000,
        timeout_seconds=600
    ),
    tools=["profiler", "query_analyzer", "cache_optimizer"],
    quality_gates={"min_improvement": 20.0}
)

# Register template
from empathy_os.orchestration.agent_templates import AGENT_REGISTRY
AGENT_REGISTRY[api_optimizer.id] = api_optimizer
```

### 4. Conditional Execution

Execute different agents based on runtime conditions:

```python
class ConditionalWorkflow:
    """Adapts execution based on project characteristics."""

    async def execute(self, project_path: str):
        # Analyze project
        has_tests = self._check_tests(project_path)
        has_security = self._check_security(project_path)

        # Build agent list conditionally
        agents = []

        if not has_tests:
            agents.append(get_template("test_coverage_analyzer"))

        if not has_security:
            agents.append(get_template("security_auditor"))

        agents.append(get_template("code_reviewer"))  # Always

        # Execute with appropriate strategy
        strategy = ParallelStrategy() if len(agents) > 1 else SequentialStrategy()
        result = await strategy.execute(agents, {"path": project_path})

        return result
```

---

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Orchestrator selects wrong agents

**Problem:** Task analysis picks agents that don't match your needs

**Solution:** Provide explicit context hints

```python
# Instead of vague task description
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Fix the code"
)

# Provide explicit domain and capabilities
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Fix security vulnerabilities in authentication module",
    context={
        "domain": "security",
        "capabilities": ["vulnerability_scan", "threat_modeling"],
        "complexity": "high"
    }
)
```

### Issue: Quality gates always fail

**Problem:** Default quality gates are too strict

**Solution:** Customize thresholds

```python
from empathy_os.workflows.orchestrated_release_prep import (
    OrchestratedReleasePrepWorkflow
)

# Custom quality gates
workflow = OrchestratedReleasePrepWorkflow(
    quality_gates={
        "min_coverage": 70.0,      # Lower threshold
        "min_quality_score": 6.0,  # More lenient
        "max_critical_issues": 1,  # Allow 1 critical
        "min_doc_coverage": 80.0   # Adjust docs requirement
    }
)
```

### Issue: Workflows too slow

**Problem:** Sequential execution is bottleneck

**Solution:** Use parallel strategy when possible

```python
# Slow: Sequential
strategy = SequentialStrategy()

# Fast: Parallel (if agents are independent)
strategy = ParallelStrategy()

# Or use Teaching pattern for cost optimization
strategy = TeachingStrategy()  # Cheap agent tries first
```

### Issue: Costs too high

**Problem:** Always using PREMIUM tier agents

**Solution:** Adjust tier preferences or use Teaching strategy

```python
# Option 1: Override agent selection
cheap_agents = [
    get_template("documentation_writer"),  # CHEAP
    get_template("code_reviewer")  # CAPABLE
]

# Option 2: Use Teaching strategy
strategy = TeachingStrategy()  # Tries cheap first, expert if needed

# Option 3: Provide complexity hint
plan = orchestrator.analyze_and_compose(
    task="Write API documentation",
    context={"complexity": "simple"}  # Favors cheaper agents
)
```

### Issue: Configuration not learning

**Problem:** Compositions aren't being saved

**Solution:** Ensure you're recording outcomes

```python
from empathy_os.orchestration.config_store import ConfigurationStore

store = ConfigurationStore()

# Save configuration after creation
config_id = store.save(config)

# IMPORTANT: Record outcome after execution
config.record_outcome(success=True, quality_score=85.0)
store.save(config)  # Update with metrics

# Verify learning
best = store.get_best_for_task(config.task_pattern)
print(f"Usage count: {best.usage_count}")  # Should increment
```
