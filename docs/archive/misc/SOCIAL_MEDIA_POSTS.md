pip install empathy-framework[developer]

🧵 1/7
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
Before v3.6.0 (frustrating 😤):

>>> NotImplementedError
# ...now what? Time to dig through source code for 30 minutes

After v3.6.0 (helpful 🎯):

>>> NotImplementedError: BaseLinterParser.parse() must be implemented.
>>> Create a subclass of BaseLinterParser and implement the parse() method.
>>> See ESLintParser, PylintParser, or MyPyParser for examples.

2/7
```

### Tweet 3 (Easy Install)
```
Installation is stupid simple:

pip install empathy-framework[developer]

Lightweight install:
• CLI tools
• LLM providers (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Ollama)
• Agents (LangChain, LangGraph)
• No enterprise bloat

2 minutes to your first workflow ⚡

3/7
```

### Tweet 4 (Enterprise Features)
```
When you're ready to scale:

pip install empathy-framework[enterprise]

Gets you:
🔐 Production auth (bcrypt + JWT)
🏥 HIPAA/GDPR compliance DB
📢 Multi-channel notifications
📊 5,941 tests passing

0 high-severity security issues from bandit scan

4/7
```

### Tweet 5 (Smart Routing)
```
Built-in cost optimization:

Smart tier routing saves 80-96% on AI API costs:
• Cheap tier: GPT-4o-mini/Haiku for simple tasks
• Capable tier: GPT-4o/Sonnet for code review
• Premium tier: o1/Opus for architecture

Auto-routes based on complexity 🧠

5/7
```

### Tweet 6 (Stats)
```
By the numbers:

📦 5,941 tests (40 new in v3.6.0)
🔒 18 auth security tests
📋 12 compliance tests
📨 10 notification tests
🏥 Used in production by healthcare orgs
🏢 Enterprise deployments

**Title:**
```
[Release] Empathy Framework v3.6.0 - Error messages that show you exactly what to implement
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/Python!

We just released v3.6.0 of Empathy Framework, and I'm particularly excited about the developer experience improvements.

**The Problem We Solved:**

How many times have you seen this?

```python
NotImplementedError
```

And then spent 30 minutes digging through source code trying to figure out which method you need to implement?

**Our Solution:**

We completely rewrote error messages across 5 base classes. Now you get:

```python
NotImplementedError: BaseLinterParser.parse() must be implemented.
Create a subclass of BaseLinterParser and implement the parse() method.
See ESLintParser, PylintParser, or MyPyParser for examples.
```

**What's Empathy Framework?**

An AI collaboration framework built on top of Claude, LangChain, and CrewAI. It adds:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Cost optimization (80-96% savings via smart tier routing)
- Pattern learning from your codebase
- Production-ready security and compliance

**Install:**

```bash
pip install empathy-framework[developer]  # Lightweight for individuals
pip install empathy-framework[enterprise]  # Backend + auth for teams
```

### r/learnprogramming (Beginner-Friendly)

**Title:**
```
Built an AI framework that gives you helpful error messages instead of cryptic ones
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone!

If you've ever been frustrated by unhelpful error messages, this might interest you.

**The Problem:**

You're learning to extend a framework, you try to run your code, and you get:

```python
NotImplementedError
```

That's it. No hint about what you need to implement or how to do it. So you spend 30 minutes reading docs and source code.

**What We Built:**

In v3.6.0 of Empathy Framework, we rewrote all our error messages to be actually helpful:

```python
NotImplementedError: BaseLinterParser.parse() must be implemented.
Create a subclass of BaseLinterParser and implement the parse() method.
See ESLintParser, PylintParser, or MyPyParser for examples.
```

Now you know:
- What method you need to implement (`parse()`)
- What class to extend (`BaseLinterParser`)
- Where to find examples (`ESLintParser`, `PylintParser`, `MyPyParser`)

**What's Empathy Framework?**

It's an AI framework for Python that helps you build AI-powered tools. Think of it as a helpful assistant for your code.

Features:
- Works with multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, local models)
- Saves you money (80-96% cost reduction via smart routing)
- Remembers context across sessions
- Includes production-ready security features

**Try It:**
```bash
pip install empathy-framework[developer]
```

Free for learning and small projects!

Happy to answer beginner questions! We built this to be accessible.
