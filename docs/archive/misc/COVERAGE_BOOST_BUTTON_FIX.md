# Coverage Boost Button Fix

**Date:** Monday, January 13, 2026, 5:00 AM
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Ready to Test
**Issue:** Coverage Boost button didn't show target input dialog

---

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Problem:**
When clicking the "Coverage Boost" button in the VSCode extension dashboard, it would run immediately with default 80% target instead of showing a dialog to customize the target percentage.

**Root Cause:**
The dashboard button was opening `WorkflowReportPanel` instead of `CoveragePanel`. The `CoveragePanel` has the proper target input UI, but it wasn't being used.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File Changed:**
`vscode-extension/src/panels/EmpathyDashboardPanel.ts` (line 820-823)

**Before:**
```typescript
private async _runOrchestratedTestCoverage() {
    // Open dedicated WorkflowReportPanel for test-coverage-boost (v4.0.0 CrewAI)
    await vscode.commands.executeCommand('empathy.openWorkflowReport', 'test-coverage-boost');
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
private async _runOrchestratedTestCoverage() {
    // Open dedicated CoveragePanel for test-coverage-boost (v4.0.0 CrewAI)
    // This panel has the target input dialog
    await vscode.commands.executeCommand('empathy.openCoveragePanel');
}
```

**Compilation:** ✅ Completed successfully (no errors)

---

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Reload VSCode Extension
1. In VSCode, press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter

This will reload the extension with the compiled changes.

### Step 2: Open Empathy Dashboard
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Empathy: Dashboard"
3. Press Enter

### Step 3: Click Coverage Boost Button
1. In the dashboard, find the "Coverage Boost" button under "Meta-Orchestration"
2. Click it
3. **Expected Result:** VS Code input box should appear at the top with:
   - Prompt: "Enter target coverage percentage (0-100)"
   - Default value: "80"
   - Input validation (only accepts 0-100)

### Step 4: Enter Custom Target
1. Type your desired coverage target (e.g., `85`)
2. Press Enter
3. **Expected Result:** Coverage Boost workflow starts with your custom target

## 🎯 Expected Workflow Flow

**Correct Flow (After Fix):**
```
User clicks "Coverage Boost" button
    ↓
CoveragePanel opens
    ↓
"Run Coverage Boost" button shown
    ↓
User clicks "Run Coverage Boost"
    ↓
VS Code input box appears
    ↓
User enters target (e.g., 85)
    ↓
Coverage Boost runs with target=85
    ↓
Results shown in CoveragePanel
```

**Incorrect Flow (Before Fix):**
```
User clicks "Coverage Boost" button
    ↓
WorkflowReportPanel opens
    ↓
Workflow runs immediately with default target=80
    ↓
No option to customize target
```

## 📊 Coverage Panel Features

The Coverage Panel includes:

### 1. Target Input
- Default: 80%
- Range: 0-100%
- Validation: Prevents invalid input

### 2. Progress Tracking
- Real-time status updates
- Current coverage display
- Target coverage display
- Improvement metrics

### 3. Results Display
- **Gaps Found:** Number of coverage gaps identified
- **Tests Generated:** Count of new tests created
- **Tests Passing:** Pass rate of generated tests
- **Coverage Improvement:** Percentage point gain
- **Cost:** API cost for generation
- **Duration:** Time taken

### 4. Top Coverage Gaps
Lists the highest-priority gaps found, with:
- File path
- Function name
- Priority score (0-1)
- Reason for prioritization

### 5. Generated Tests
Shows sample of generated tests with:
- Test name
- Target function
- Target file
- Expected coverage impact

## 🔄 Alternative: CLI Usage

If the button still doesn't work, you can run Coverage Boost from the command line:

```bash
# With default target (80%)
empathy workflow run test-coverage-boost

# With custom target
empathy workflow run test-coverage-boost --input '{"target_coverage": 85}'

# From Python
python -m attune.cli workflow run test-coverage-boost --input '{"target_coverage": 85}'
```

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify the fix:

- [ ] VSCode window reloaded after compilation
- [ ] Dashboard opened successfully
- [ ] Coverage Boost button clicked
- [ ] CoveragePanel opened (not WorkflowReportPanel)
- [ ] "Run Coverage Boost" button visible in panel
- [ ] Clicked "Run Coverage Boost" button
- [ ] Input box appeared at top of VS Code
- [ ] Default value "80" shown
- [ ] Entered custom target (e.g., "85")
- [ ] Input validation worked (rejects invalid values)
- [ ] Workflow started with custom target
- [ ] Results displayed in Coverage Panel
- [ ] Coverage metrics updated

---

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check Extension is Running:**
   - Look for "Empathy Framework" in Extensions panel
   - Ensure it's enabled (not disabled)

2. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - In VSCode: Help → Toggle Developer Tools
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Look for messages starting with `[CoveragePanel]`

3. **Verify Compilation:**
   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   npm run compile
   # Should complete with no errors
   ```

4. **Check File Permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la vscode-extension/out/panels/EmpathyDashboardPanel.js
   # Should exist and be readable
   ```

5. **Nuclear Option (Clean Rebuild):**
   ```bash
   cd vscode-extension
   rm -rf out/
   npm run compile
   # Then reload VSCode window
   ```

## 📈 Expected Coverage Boost Results

Based on previous run (default 80% target):

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Tests Generated** | 9 |
| **Pass Rate** | 55.6% (5/9) |
| **Coverage Gain** | +3.2% |
| **Cost** | $0.07 |
| **Duration** | 53 seconds |

**With Custom Target (e.g., 85%):**
- May generate more tests
- Higher target may push for more coverage
- Cost scales with number of tests generated

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

### If Button Works Correctly:

1. **Run with Higher Target:**
   - Try target=90% or 95%
   - See if more tests are generated
   - Compare quality vs default 80%

2. **Evaluate Results:**
   - Check pass rate of generated tests
   - Review coverage gaps identified
   - Assess if gaps match actual needs

3. **Compare with Manual Tests:**
   - Coverage Boost: 9 tests, 55.6% pass rate, +3.2% coverage
   - My LLM tests: 533 tests, 93.4% pass rate, ~20-30% coverage
   - Which approach is better for your needs?

### If Coverage Boost Quality is Low:

Loop back to **Option A:** Continue fixing remaining 35 test failures to get to 95%+ pass rate with existing high-quality tests.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

**Short-term:**
1. Test the fixed button with default target (80%)
2. If it works, try target=90%
3. Evaluate quality of generated tests

**If Coverage Boost Quality < 80%:**
- Use my existing 498 passing tests (93.4% quality)
- I can continue fixing remaining 35 failures (1-2 hours)
- Get to 95-98% pass rate with proven approach

**If Coverage Boost Quality ≥ 80%:**
- Consider using Coverage Boost for new gap discovery
- Combine with manual fixes for comprehensive coverage
- Best of both worlds

---

**Status:** ✅ Fix applied and compiled
**Action Required:** Reload VSCode and test the button
**Fallback:** CLI command always works if button fails
