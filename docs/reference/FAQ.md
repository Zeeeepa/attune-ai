## Getting Started

### What is the Attune AI?

Attune AI is an open-source Python framework that gives AI assistants persistent memory, multi-agent coordination, and anticipatory intelligence.

**Core capabilities:**
- 🧠 **Persistent Memory**: Pattern library that survives sessions (git-based + optional Redis)
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination**: AI teams that share context and validate each other
- 🔮 **Anticipatory Intelligence**: Predicts bugs 30-90 days out based on learned patterns
- 🛡️ **Enterprise-Ready**: Local-first, HIPAA-compliant options, comprehensive security
- 💰 **Cost Optimization**: Smart tier routing saves 80-96% on LLM costs

**Quick start:**
```bash
pip install attune-ai
empathy-memory serve
```

**Learn more:** [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/index.md)

---

### What are the "5 Levels of Empathy"?

The framework defines five levels of AI-human collaboration:

1. **Level 1 (Reactive):** Responds only when asked
2. **Level 2 (Guided):** Asks clarifying questions
3. **Level 3 (Proactive):** Notices patterns, offers improvements
4. **Level 4 (Anticipatory):** Predicts problems before they happen
5. **Level 5 (Transformative):** Reshapes workflows to prevent problem classes

## Teaching AI Your Standards

### How do I teach AI my coding standards?

Instead of repeating standards in every session, create a project-level standards file with real code examples.

**Step 1:** Create a standards reference file (`.ai/python-standards.md` or similar)

**Step 2:** Document patterns with examples:

```python
## Security: Never Use eval()

### ❌ Prohibited
user_input = request.get("formula")
result = eval(user_input)  # Code injection vulnerability!

### ✅ Required
import ast
try:
    data = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
except (ValueError, SyntaxError) as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid input: {e}")

**Why:** eval() enables arbitrary code execution
**Exception:** None. Always use ast.literal_eval() or json.loads()
```

**Step 3:** Add to project context:
- Claude Code: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- GitHub Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Cursor: `.cursorrules`

**Learn more:** [Teaching AI Your Standards](../explanation/TEACHING_AI_YOUR_PHILOSOPHY.md) (11,000 words)

---

### What's the difference between prompting and project memory?

**Traditional prompting:**
- Include instructions in every prompt
- Consumes context window
- Need to repeat every session
- Example: "Use type hints. Validate paths. [Your question]"

**Project memory:**
- Standards loaded once at session start
- Available on-demand
- Persists across all sessions
- Zero context window cost
- Example: Just ask your question, AI knows standards

**Think of it like:**
- Prompting = telling someone the rules every time
- Project memory = giving them a handbook once

---

### Can you share an example standards file?

Yes! Our production standards file is available:

**Location:** `.claude/rules/attune/coding-standards-index.md`

**Contents:**
- Security rules (eval, path validation, SQL injection)
- Exception handling patterns
- File operations
- Testing requirements
- Pre-commit hook configurations
- Real code examples from production

**Size:** 1,170 lines with real patterns

**How to use:** Adapt for your team's needs, your language, your patterns

---

### How much time does this save?

**Our measured results (30 days):**

**Before:**
- 47% of code review comments were standards violations
- 12 linter violations per PR average
- ~2 hours/week explaining standards

**After:**
- 18% of code review comments are standards violations (-62%)
- 3 linter violations per PR average (-75%)
- ~20 min/week on standards questions (-83%)
- 0 security issues caught in review (all prevented at source)

**Time saved:** ~80 hours/month in code review

**Your results will vary based on:**
- Team size (solo: 10-20h/month, team of 5+: 100+h/month)
- Current code review burden
- How often you repeat standards

---

## Tool Compatibility

### Does this work with GitHub Copilot?

Yes! GitHub Copilot supports project-level instructions.

**Setup:**
1. Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your repository
2. Add your coding standards with examples
3. Copilot reads it automatically

**Example:**
```markdown
# Python Coding Standards

Follow the patterns in .ai/python-standards.md

Always:
- Use type hints
- Validate file paths before operations
- Catch specific exceptions
- Use ast.literal_eval() instead of eval()
```

**Learn more:** [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

---

### Does this work with Cursor?

Yes! Cursor supports project rules via `.cursorrules` file.

**Setup:**
1. Create `.cursorrules` in project root
2. Add your standards
3. Cursor applies them automatically

**Example:**
```
Follow Python standards in .ai/python-standards.md
Use type hints, validate file paths, catch specific exceptions
```

**Learn more:** [Cursor Documentation](https://docs.cursor.sh)

---

### Does this work with Claude Code?

Yes! Claude Code has native support for project memory.

**Setup:**
1. Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project
2. Reference standards with `@./path/to/standards.md`
3. Claude loads them at session start

**Example:**
```markdown
# Project Context

## Python Standards
@./python-standards.md

Critical rules:
- Never use eval() or exec()
- Validate all file paths
- Use specific exceptions
```

**Learn more:** [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs)

---

### Does this work with ChatGPT?

Not yet. ChatGPT doesn't currently support persistent project-level context. You would need to include standards in each conversation.

**Alternatives:**
- Create a custom GPT with standards in instructions
- Use a browser extension to inject standards
- Copy/paste standards at conversation start

---

## Implementation

### How long does setup take?

**Initial setup:** 4-8 hours
- Identify top 5-10 coding standard violations (1-2 hours)
- Document with real code examples (2-4 hours)
- Write actual implementation functions (1-2 hours)
- Add to project context (30 minutes)

**Maintenance:** ~1 hour/month
- Update when standards change
- Add new patterns as discovered
- Keep examples current

**ROI:** Pays back in first week for teams with regular code reviews

---

### What should I document first?

Start with your **top 5 coding standard violations**:

1. Look at last 10 code reviews
2. What do you keep commenting about?
3. Document those patterns first

**Common starting points:**
- Security: eval(), path validation, SQL injection
- Type hints / type checking
- Exception handling (specific vs bare)
- File operations (context managers, validation)
- Logging patterns

**Don't try to document everything at once.** Start small, add patterns as you encounter them.

---

### Should I use abstract rules or real code?

**Always use real code examples**, not abstract descriptions.

**❌ Bad (abstract):**
```
Always handle errors properly
Use best practices
Follow team conventions
```

**✅ Good (concrete):**
```python
## Error Handling: Catch Specific Exceptions

### ❌ Prohibited
try:
    risky_operation()
except:  # Masks KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit
    pass

### ✅ Required
try:
    risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid value: {e}")
    raise
except IOError as e:
    logger.warning(f"IO error: {e}")
    return default_value

**Why:** Bare except catches system signals, makes debugging impossible
```

**Include:**
- ❌ What NOT to do (with code example)
- ✅ What TO do instead (with code example)
- **Why** it matters (security? performance? maintainability?)
- Your actual implementation (show the function from your codebase)

---

### How do I adapt this for TypeScript?

The pattern works for any language. Here's TypeScript example:

```typescript
// .ai/typescript-standards.md

## Error Handling: Custom Error Classes

### ❌ Prohibited
if (!user) {
  throw new Error("User not found");
}

### ✅ Required
export class UserNotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(userId: string) {
    super(`User not found: ${userId}`);
    this.name = 'UserNotFoundError';
  }
}

if (!user) {
  throw new UserNotFoundError(userId);
}

// Usage in try-catch
try {
  const user = await getUser(id);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof UserNotFoundError) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: error.message });
  }
  throw error; // Re-throw unexpected errors
}

**Why:** Type-safe error handling, better logging, clearer debugging
```

**Add to:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `.cursorrules`

---

### How do I keep standards updated?

**Integrate with code review process:**

1. **When code review finds violation:**
   - Fix the code
   - Add pattern to standards file
   - Show ❌ bad pattern (what was just fixed)
   - Show ✅ good pattern (what to do instead)
   - Explain why

2. **Time investment:** ~10 minutes per violation

3. **Result:** Pattern doesn't repeat

**Example workflow:**
```
Code review finds: bare except:
→ Fix it: catch ValueError specifically
→ Add to standards file (takes 10 min)
→ AI generates correct pattern next time
→ Never see that violation again
```

**Pro tip:** Make updating standards part of your review checklist.

---

## Cost Optimization

### What is intelligent tier fallback?

**NEW in v3.10.0:** Automatic cost optimization that tries cheaper tiers first and only upgrades when quality gates fail.

**How it works:**
1. Start with CHEAP tier (Haiku - $0.03/1M tokens)
2. Validate output with quality gates
3. If validation fails → upgrade to CAPABLE (Sonnet 4.5 - $0.09/1M)
4. Still failing? → upgrade to PREMIUM (Opus 4.5 - $0.45/1M)
5. Track savings and learn from patterns

**Enable it:**
```bash
empathy workflow run health-check --use-recommended-tier
```

**Expected savings:** 30-50% on average workflow execution

**Learn more:** CHANGELOG.md v3.10.0

---

### When should I use tier fallback?

**✅ Use tier fallback when:**
- Cost is a primary concern
- Workflow has measurable quality metrics (health score, test coverage)
- CHEAP tier often succeeds (simple refactoring, docs, health checks)
- You can tolerate 2-3x latency increase on quality failures
- You want automatic cost optimization

**❌ Don't use tier fallback when:**
- Time is critical (tier upgrades add latency)
- Quality gates are hard to define
- PREMIUM tier is always required (complex reasoning, novel problems)
- You prefer predictable performance over cost savings

**Best for:** health-check, test-gen, doc-gen, refactoring workflows

**Not ideal for:** complex debugging, architecture design, novel feature implementation

---

### How much can I save with tier fallback?

**Real savings depend on your workflow success rates:**

**Scenario 1: CHEAP often succeeds (60% of stages)**
- Both stages succeed at CHEAP: **~90% savings** vs. all-PREMIUM
- Typical result: **60-70% overall savings**

**Scenario 2: Mixed success (40% CHEAP, 40% CAPABLE, 20% PREMIUM)**
- Real-world mix: **40-50% savings** vs. all-PREMIUM

**Scenario 3: CHEAP rarely succeeds (20% of stages)**
- Most stages need CAPABLE or PREMIUM: **10-20% savings**
- May not be worth the latency cost

**Track your actual savings:**
```bash
empathy telemetry savings --days 30
```

**See detailed breakdown:** TIER_FALLBACK_TEST_REPORT.md

---

### What are quality gates?

**Quality gates = validation checks that decide if a tier's output is acceptable.**

**Default quality gates** (all workflows):
- ✅ Execution succeeded (no exceptions)
- ✅ Output is not empty
- ✅ No error keys in response

**Workflow-specific gates** (health-check):
- ✅ Health score ≥ 95 (configurable with `--health-score-threshold`)
- ✅ Diagnosis data present
- ✅ Required fields populated

**Custom quality gates:** Override `validate_output()` in your workflow:
```python
def validate_output(self, stage_output: dict) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
    # Custom validation logic
    if stage_output.get("confidence", 0) < 0.8:
        return False, "confidence_too_low"
    return True, None
```

**See code:** `src/attune/workflows/base.py:156-187`

---

### Can I customize the tier fallback behavior?

**Yes! Several customization options:**

**1. Change the starting threshold:**
```bash
empathy workflow run health-check --use-recommended-tier --health-score-threshold 90
```

**2. Use Python API for full control:**
```python
from attune.workflows import get_workflow

workflow_cls = get_workflow("health-check")
workflow = workflow_cls(
    provider="anthropic",
    enable_tier_fallback=True,
    health_score_threshold=95,  # Custom threshold
)

result = await workflow.execute(path=".")
```

**3. Create custom workflows with specific quality gates:**
```python
class MyWorkflow(BaseWorkflow):
    def validate_output(self, stage_output: dict) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
        # Your custom validation logic
        pass
```

**See examples:** CHANGELOG.md Migration Guide

---

### Is tier fallback production-ready?

**Yes!** Fully tested and validated:

- ✅ **8/8 unit tests passing** (100%)
- ✅ **89% code coverage** on tier_tracking module
- ✅ **Zero lint errors, zero type errors**
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling**
- ✅ **Backward compatible** (opt-in, default behavior unchanged)
- ✅ **Full telemetry tracking**

**Deployment checklist completed:**
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage ≥80% on critical modules
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md entry added
- ✅ Migration guide available

**See full validation:** TIER_FALLBACK_TEST_REPORT.md

---

## Results & ROI

### What results can I expect?

**Conservative estimates (based on our data):**

**Solo developer:**
- Time saved: 10-20 hours/month
- Code review improvements: -40% standards comments
- Prevention: 2-3 bugs caught before writing

**Team of 5:**
- Time saved: 50-100 hours/month
- Code review improvements: -60% standards comments
- Prevention: 5-10 bugs caught before writing

**Team of 10+:**
- Time saved: 100-200 hours/month
- Code review improvements: -70% standards comments
- Prevention: 10-20 bugs caught before writing

**Key factors:**
- Current code review burden
- How often you repeat standards
- Team size and turnover
- Codebase complexity

---

### How do I measure impact?

**Track these metrics for 30 days:**

**Before implementation:**
- % of code review comments on standards
- Linter violations per PR
- Time spent explaining standards
- Security issues caught in review

**After implementation:**
- Same metrics
- Calculate reduction
- Note patterns that stopped recurring

**Example tracking:**
```
Week 1: 15 linter violations, 12 standards comments
Week 2: 12 linter violations, 9 standards comments
Week 3: 8 linter violations, 6 standards comments
Week 4: 5 linter violations, 4 standards comments

Result: -67% violations, -67% comments
```

---

## Common Concerns

### Isn't this overengineered?

**Fair question! It depends on your situation.**

**When this is overkill:**
- Solo dev who rarely repeats standards
- Small team with perfect code review adherence
- Simple codebase with few patterns
- No security requirements

**When this pays off:**
- Team of 3+ developers
- Onboarding new developers regularly
- Recurring standards violations in code review
- Complex codebase with security requirements
- High cost of bugs (security, compliance, $$$)

**The lightweight version:**
- Document top 3 violations only
- Skip the rest
- Still saves time, much less work

**Our take:** If you find yourself repeating the same code review comment 5+ times, document it.

---

### Does AI replace code review?

**No! This complements code review, doesn't replace it.**

**What it does:**
- Reduces noise (fewer "use type hints" comments)
- Lets reviewers focus on logic, architecture, edge cases
- Prevents obvious issues

**What it doesn't do:**
- Replace human judgment
- Catch business logic bugs
- Understand context-specific requirements
- Make architectural decisions

**Think of it like a linter on steroids:**
- Linters catch syntax issues
- This catches patterns linters can't detect
- Humans focus on the hard problems

**You still need code review** - just less time on repetitive standards enforcement.

---

### What about AI hallucinations?

**Valid concern! Here's how we handle it:**

**1. Reference actual implementations:**
```python
## File Path Validation

### Our Implementation: src/utils/validation.py:15-40

[Paste actual function from your codebase]
```

When AI uses `validate_file_path()`, it's using a tested, production function, not generating something new.

**2. Include test patterns:**
```python
## Tests Required

def test_validate_file_path_blocks_traversal():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        validate_file_path("../../etc/passwd")
```

AI generates tests that match your existing test suite.

**3. Code review still catches issues:**
- AI-generated code goes through normal review
- Standards reduce noise, but humans verify logic

**4. Start with high-confidence patterns:**
- Security rules (eval, path validation)
- Well-established best practices
- Patterns you've used 100+ times

---

### What if my team disagrees on standards?

**Document the disagreement and decision:**

```python
## String Formatting: Use f-strings (Python 3.6+)

### ❌ Prohibited
name = "Alice"
message = "Hello, %s" % name  # Old style
message = "Hello, {}".format(name)  # Verbose

### ✅ Required
message = f"Hello, {name}"  # Readable, fast

**Team decision (2024-03-15):**
- Discussed .format() vs f-strings
- Chose f-strings for readability
- Exception: When string is reused with different values
- Documented in standards for new team members
```

**Benefits:**
- New team members see the decision
- Context preserved ("why did we choose this?")
- Reduces re-litigating decisions
- Standards document becomes team memory

---

## Advanced Topics

### Can I share standards across multiple projects?

Yes! Use symlinks or git submodules:

```
company-standards/
├── python-standards.md
├── typescript-standards.md
└── security-baseline.md

project-a/
├── .claude/CLAUDE.md
│   # References: @../company-standards/python-standards.md
└── src/

project-b/
├── .claude/CLAUDE.md
│   # References: @../company-standards/python-standards.md
└── src/
```

**Benefits:**
- Update once, applies everywhere
- Consistent standards across org
- New projects inherit standards automatically

---

### How do I handle language-specific vs general standards?

**Structure by specificity:**

```
standards/
├── general.md              # Applies to all projects
│   ├── Code review process
│   ├── Git commit format
│   └── Documentation requirements
├── security-baseline.md    # Applies to all code
│   ├── Never use eval()
│   ├── Validate all inputs
│   └── Authentication patterns
└── python/
    ├── security.md         # Python-specific security
    ├── testing.md          # Python testing patterns
    └── style.md            # Python style guide
```

**Reference in project:**
```markdown
# .claude/CLAUDE.md

@../standards/general.md
@../standards/security-baseline.md
@../standards/python/security.md
@../standards/python/testing.md
```

---

### Can I use this for data science workflows?

Absolutely! Example patterns:

```python
## Data Validation: Check DataFrame Schema

### ❌ Prohibited
result = df['column_name']  # KeyError if missing

### ✅ Required
def validate_dataframe(df: pd.DataFrame, required_cols: list[str]):
    """Validate DataFrame has required columns."""
    missing = set(required_cols) - set(df.columns)
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"Missing columns: {missing}")

validate_dataframe(df, ['user_id', 'timestamp', 'value'])
result = df['column_name']

**Tests:**
- Missing column handling
- Type validation (int vs float)
- NaN/null handling
```

**Other DS patterns:**
- Data validation (schema, types, ranges)
- Reproducibility (random seeds, versioning)
- Performance (vectorization, avoid loops)
- Visualization (consistent styling, labels)

---

### How do I version control standards?

**Treat standards like code:**

```bash
git add .claude/rules/python-standards.md
git commit -m "docs: Add SQL injection prevention pattern"
git push
```

**Use CHANGELOG:**
```markdown
# Standards Changelog

## 2026-01-07
- Added: SQL injection prevention pattern
- Updated: Exception handling (added cleanup pattern)
- Removed: Deprecated string formatting rules

## 2025-12-15
- Added: Path validation for file operations
- Updated: Type hints (Python 3.10 syntax)
```

**Benefits:**
- Track what changed and when
- See evolution of standards
- Revert if pattern doesn't work
- Team sees updates in pull requests
