## Key Messaging

All content uses the unified **5 Problems / 6 Solutions** framework:

### The Problem Statement
> "Today's AI tools are brilliant but broken for enterprise use."

**5 Problems:**
1. **Stateless** — forget everything between sessions
2. **Cloud-dependent** — data leaves your infrastructure
3. **Isolated** — can't coordinate with other agents
4. **Reactive** — wait for problems instead of preventing them
5. **Expensive** — every query costs the same

### The Solution
> "Empathy solves all five."

**7 Solutions:**
1. Memory That Persists (git-based patterns + optional Redis)
2. Enterprise-Ready (local-first, compliance)
3. Anticipatory Intelligence (30-90 day predictions)
4. Build Better Agents (30+ wizards, toolkit)
5. Human↔AI & AI↔AI Orchestration
6. Performance & Cost (smart routing + no repeated context)
7. **NEW:** Code Health Assistant (automated checks + auto-fix)

### Quick Start
```bash
pip install empathy-framework
empathy-memory serve
```

### New in v2.2 - Code Health Assistant

**One command to check everything:**

```bash
empathy health           # Quick check (lint, format, types)
empathy health --deep    # Full check (+ tests, security, deps)
empathy health --fix     # Auto-fix safe issues
```

**Features:**
- Weighted health score (0-100)
- Auto-fix for lint and format issues
- Trend tracking over time
- Hotspot detection

### Demo Script

**Interactive showcase of memory-enhanced capabilities:**

```bash
python examples/persistent_memory_showcase.py
```

Demonstrates:
1. Bug Pattern Correlation - "This bug looks like one we fixed 3 months ago"
2. Tech Debt Trajectory - "At current trajectory, debt doubles in 90 days"
3. Security False Positive Learning - "Suppressing 8 warnings you marked as acceptable"
4. **NEW:** Code Health Check - "87/100 health score, 3 auto-fixable issues"
