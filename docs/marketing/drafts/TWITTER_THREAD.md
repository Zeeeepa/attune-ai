**1/5**
Just shipped empathy-framework v3.3.0

- Auto file export for large docs
- 80% cost savings with smart routing

pip install empathy-framework==3.3.0

**2/5**
The problem with AI workflows:

Raw JSON. Terminal truncation. Surprise $50 bills.

v3.3.0 fix: Every workflow returns a `formatted_report`

Consistent structure. Status icons. Actionable summaries.

Enterprise doc-gen for large codebases:

```python
workflow = DocumentGenerationWorkflow(
    export_path="docs/generated",
    max_cost=5.0,  # Cost guardrail
    chunked_generation=True,
)
```

Auto-scaling. Chunked generation. File export.

No more truncated docs.

**4/5**
Cost savings still real:

Cheap tier: Haiku/GPT-4o-mini ($0.25/M)
Capable tier: Sonnet/GPT-4o ($3/M)
Premium tier: Opus/o1 ($15/M)

Smart routing picks automatically.

$4.05 → $0.83 per task = 80% saved

---

**5/5**
All 10 workflows now have formatted reports:

- security-audit
- code-review
- perf-audit
- doc-gen
- test-gen
- + 5 more
