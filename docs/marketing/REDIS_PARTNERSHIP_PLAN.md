## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Up (Week 1)

**Actions:**
1. Follow Redis on Twitter/LinkedIn
2. Join Redis Discord community
3. Engage with their content (meaningful comments, not spam)
4. Star/watch Redis repos on GitHub
5. Write a blog post mentioning Redis (not asking for anything)

**Blog Post Idea:**
> "How We Built Real-Time AI Memory with Redis"
> - Technical deep-dive on our Redis usage
> - Publish on our blog, share on social
> - Tag Redis when sharing

### Phase 2: Initial Contact (Week 2)

**Option A: Partners Program Application**
```
Subject: Technology Partner Application - AI Memory Framework

Hi Redis Partners Team,

I'm the founder of Smart AI Memory, creators of the Empathy Framework -
an open-source AI collaboration platform with persistent memory.

We use Redis as the real-time coordination layer for multi-agent AI
orchestration. Our architecture demonstrates a novel Redis use case:
sub-millisecond state sharing between AI agents.

Key stats:
- Open source: github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy
- PyPI: 5,000+ downloads
- Use case: Enterprise AI with local-first privacy

We'd love to explore a technology partnership. We can offer:
- Technical blog posts about our Redis integration
- Speaking at Redis events
- Community showcase material

Would love to discuss how we might work together.

Best,
Patrick Roebuck
Founder, Smart AI Memory
```

**Option B: DevRel Direct Outreach (LinkedIn/Twitter)**
```
Hi [Name],

Saw your talk on [topic] - great insights on [specific point].

We built something that might interest you: an AI memory framework
that uses Redis for real-time multi-agent coordination. Think
"AI that remembers" powered by Redis.

Would love to show you a quick demo if you're curious. No pitch,
just think it's a cool Redis use case.

[Link to GitHub]

Cheers,
Patrick
```

### Phase 3: Follow-Up (Week 3-4)

1. If no response: Follow up once (politely)
2. If interested: Prepare demo
3. If redirected: Follow their process

### Phase 4: Relationship Building (Ongoing)

1. Continue engaging with Redis content
2. Submit to Redis community showcases
3. Write case study for their review
4. Offer to speak at local Redis meetups

## Demo Prep for Redis

### What to Show

1. **The Problem**
   - AI tools forget everything between sessions
   - Need for real-time coordination between agents

2. **Redis in Action**
   - Show Redis being used for short-term memory
   - Demonstrate sub-millisecond coordination
   - Show the architecture diagram

3. **The Results**
   - Before/after: 0 context vs. persistent context
   - Performance metrics
   - Enterprise adoption potential

### Demo Script

```bash
# Show Redis integration
empathy-memory serve

# Show real-time coordination
# (have a demo that shows agents sharing state via Redis)

# Show the architecture
cat docs/SECURE_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Materials to Prepare

- [ ] 2-minute video demo of Redis integration
- [ ] Architecture diagram highlighting Redis
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (Redis query times)
- [ ] Slide deck: "AI Memory with Redis"

---

## Talking Points

### Why Redis (Not Alternatives)

> "We chose Redis for AI memory coordination because:
> 1. Sub-millisecond latency for real-time agent decisions
> 2. Simple key-value model maps perfectly to memory contexts
> 3. Pub/sub for agent-to-agent notifications
> 4. Redis Stack potential for vector search (future)
> 5. Enterprise-ready with Redis Cloud option"

### The Opportunity for Redis

> "AI memory is an emerging category. Right now, most AI tools are
> stateless. As enterprises demand AI that remembers, Redis is
> perfectly positioned as the memory layer. We're early movers in
> this space and would love to help Redis tell this story."

### Differentiator

> "Unlike other AI frameworks that just use Redis for caching, we use
> it as the core coordination layer. Redis isn't optional in our
> architecture—it's what makes real-time multi-agent AI possible."

## Content to Create

### For Redis Partnership

1. **Technical Blog Post**
   - "Building Real-Time AI Memory with Redis"
   - Detailed architecture, code examples
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Publish on our blog first, offer to cross-post

2. **Case Study**
   - Problem → Solution → Results format
   - Include metrics
   - Quote from a user if possible

3. **Demo Video**
   - 2-3 minutes
   - Show Redis in action
   - "Powered by Redis" messaging

4. **Architecture Diagram**
   - Clean, professional
   - Redis prominently featured
   - Usable by their marketing team

---

## Timeline

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Warm up: Follow, engage, write blog post |
| 2 | Submit partner application OR DevRel outreach |
| 3 | Follow up if needed, prepare demo materials |
| 4 | Demo call (if scheduled) |
| 5+ | Relationship building, content collaboration |

---

## Success Metrics

**Short-term (1 month):**
- [ ] Response from Redis team
- [ ] Initial call scheduled
- [ ] Listed in community showcase

**Medium-term (3 months):**
- [ ] Official partner status
- [ ] Joint blog post published
- [ ] Feature in Redis newsletter

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- [ ] Speaking at Redis event
- [ ] Redis Cloud credits/sponsorship
- [ ] Strategic partnership discussions

---

## Risk Mitigation

**If No Response:**
- Continue building community presence
- Submit to their showcase/community pages
- Try different contact points
- Be patient - large companies move slowly

**If They Say No:**
- Ask for feedback
- Ask about community showcase (lower bar)
- Continue using/promoting Redis anyway
- Revisit in 6 months with more traction

**If They Want Changes:**
- Be flexible on integration details
- Consider their feedback seriously
- Maintain our core architecture

---

## Notes

- Redis recently IPO'd - they may be more interested in enterprise use cases
- AI is hot - they likely want AI ecosystem stories
- Don't be pushy - relationship first, partnership second
- Be genuinely helpful to their community
- Our Fair Source license shouldn't be a blocker (we're promoting their product)

Hi Redis Partners Team,

I'm Patrick Roebuck, founder of Smart AI Memory. We've built the Empathy Framework—an open-source AI collaboration platform that uses Redis as the real-time coordination layer for multi-agent orchestration.

**Why This Matters for Redis:**

Most AI tools use Redis for caching. We use it as the core coordination layer for AI memory—a novel use case that demonstrates Redis beyond traditional caching.

**Our Redis Usage:**
- Session context storage (sub-millisecond reads)
- Multi-agent task coordination (SET NX for claiming, LPUSH for sharing)
- Real-time agent notifications (PUB/SUB)
- Short-term conversation memory (sliding window lists)

**Key Stats:**
- Open source: github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy
- PyPI downloads: 5,000+
- Use case: Enterprise AI with local-first privacy
- Compliance: HIPAA patterns included (healthcare customers)

**What We Can Offer:**
- Technical blog posts about our Redis architecture (we've published one: [link])
- Speaking at Redis events
- Community showcase material
- Real production code demonstrating Redis for AI

**What We'd Love:**
- Featured in Redis ecosystem/showcase
- Consideration for co-marketing
- Redis Cloud credits for demos (optional)

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how we might work together. Happy to do a quick demo call at your convenience.

Best regards,
Patrick Roebuck
