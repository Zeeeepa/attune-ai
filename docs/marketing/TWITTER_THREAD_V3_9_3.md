# Twitter Thread: Empathy Framework v3.9.3

**Campaign**: Teaching AI to Prevent Security Bugs
**Version**: v3.9.3 (Current)
**Date**: January 9, 2026
**Platform**: Twitter/X

---

## Tweet 1: Hook

```
We just taught @AnthropicAI Claude how to never write insecure code.

The method: Put our coding standards in its project memory with real code examples.

The result: 174 security tests, 0 vulnerabilities, 100/100 health score.

Here's how 🧵

#Python #Security #AI
```

**Character count**: 268/280

---

## Tweet 2: The Problem

```
We secured 6 modules against path traversal (CWE-22).

Added 174 security tests (+1,143% increase).

Fixed every vulnerability.

But we'd just write the same bugs in new code.

We needed to teach Claude the patterns, not just fix instances.
```

**Character count**: 254/280

---

## Tweet 3: The Solution

```
We created a 1,170-line coding standards reference with real examples:

❌ What NOT to do (with CVE)
✅ What to do instead (actual code from our codebase)
📚 Why it matters (attack scenarios)
🧪 How to test it (test patterns)

Then put it in .claude/
```

**Character count**: 267/280

---

## Tweet 4: Implementation

```
The coding standards include:

• Path validation function (_validate_file_path)
• Security test patterns
• Exception handling examples
• Common false positives to avoid

Real code, not examples. From src/empathy_os/config.py:29-68

Claude can reference it anytime.
```

**Character count**: 279/280

## Tweet 5: The Results

```
v3.9.3 achievements:

🔒 174 security tests (was 14)
🛡️ 0 current vulnerabilities
✅ 100/100 health score
📚 1,170-line standards reference
🎯 6 modules secured (Pattern 6)

All verifiable in the codebase.

```

**Character count**: 268/280

---

## Tweet 6: How It Works

```
When Claude generates code now:

✅ Uses _validate_file_path() for user paths
✅ Never uses eval() or exec()
✅ Catches specific exceptions
✅ Includes security tests

Not because we prompt it each time.

Because the standards are in project memory.
```

**Character count**: 267/280

## Tweet 7: The Guides

```
We documented the entire approach:

📖 Five Levels of Empathy (15,000 words)
📖 Teaching AI Your Standards (11,000 words)
📖 Coding Standards Reference (1,170 lines)

All open source.

Verified with Claude Code. Pattern adaptable to other tools.

```

**Character count**: 280/280

## Tweet 8: Try It Yourself

```
To implement this pattern:

1. Identify your top 5 coding violations
2. Document with real code examples (not abstract rules)
3. Show your actual implementation
4. Add to .claude/ or .cursorrules

pip install empathy-framework

We wrote the guides. You adapt for your stack.

## Pre-Prepared Responses

### "How is this different from prompting?"

```
Project memory vs prompting:

Prompting:
- Every session you repeat "use type hints"
- Takes up context window
- Generic advice

Project memory:
- Standards loaded once at session start
- On-demand reference (doesn't fill context)
- Real code examples from your codebase
- Persists forever
```

### "Can I see your standards file?"

```
Absolutely!

Coding standards reference (1,170 lines):
github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy-framework/blob/main/.claude/rules/empathy/coding-standards-index.md

Includes:
✅ Real vulnerable code examples
✅ Real secure code examples
✅ Security test patterns
✅ Common false positives

Fork and adapt for your team.
```

### "What are the actual metrics?"

```
Verifiable facts:

• 174 security tests (was 14 in v3.0)
• +1,143% increase in security test coverage
• 6 modules secured against path traversal
• 0 current vulnerabilities (verified by security scan)
• 100/100 health score (v3.9.3)
• Zero type errors in production code

All in the codebase: github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy-framework
```

### "Does this work with [other AI tool]?"

```
Yes! The pattern is universal:

• Claude Code: .claude/CLAUDE.md
• GitHub Copilot: .github/copilot-instructions.md
• Cursor: .cursorrules
• Cody: .cody/rules.md

Key: Use real code examples, not abstract rules.

Guide with examples for all tools:

```

### "How do you measure success?"

```
We don't claim to measure time saved or ROI.

We measure technical facts:
• Test coverage increased 1,143%
• Vulnerabilities found: 0
• Health score: 100/100
• Type errors: 0

Whether this saves you time depends on:
- Your codebase
- Team size
- How often you repeat standards
```

## Success Metrics

**Technical (verifiable)**:
- GitHub stars gained
- PyPI downloads
- GitHub traffic from Twitter
- Issues/discussions created

**Engagement**:
- Impressions: 10K+ target
- Retweets: 50+ target
- Meaningful replies: 30+ target

**NOT measuring**: Time saved, ROI, adoption rates (can't verify)

---

## Visual Assets

**Optional for Tweet 3 or 5**: Side-by-side code comparison

Use Carbon.now.sh:
- Left: Vulnerable code with `open(user_path)`
- Right: Secure code with `_validate_file_path(user_path)`

Instructions in: docs/marketing/TWEET3_CODE_COMPARISON.md

## What We DON'T Claim

❌ "Saves 80 hours/month" - Can't verify for users
❌ "Tracked over 30 days" - No controlled study
❌ "-62% violations" - Not precisely measured
❌ "Guaranteed ROI" - Depends on user's context

✅ We share what we built
✅ We share the technical facts
✅ We let users decide if it's useful

**Status**: Ready for review
**All claims**: Verifiable in codebase or documentation
**Version**: Updated to v3.9.3 (current)
