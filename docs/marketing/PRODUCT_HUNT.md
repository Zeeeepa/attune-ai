## Product Details

### Product Name
**Empathy Framework**

### Tagline (60 characters max)
AI collaboration with persistent memory and multi-agent orchestration

**Alternatives:**
- Enterprise AI that remembers, coordinates, and predicts
- Local-first AI framework with memory and anticipation

### Short Description (120 characters)
The AI collaboration framework that predicts problems before they happen. Persistent memory. Local-first. Multi-agent ready.

---

## Full Description

### Paragraph 1: The Problem
Today's AI tools are brilliant but broken for enterprise use. They forget everything between sessions. Your data leaves your infrastructure. They can't coordinate with other agents. They wait for problems instead of preventing them. And every query costs the same regardless of complexity.

### Paragraph 2: The Solution
Empathy Framework solves all five. Dual-layer memory — git-based pattern storage for long-term knowledge (zero infrastructure required) plus optional Redis for real-time coordination — means AI that learns across sessions. Local-first architecture keeps your data on your infrastructure. Built-in multi-agent orchestration through Empathy OS. Anticipatory intelligence predicts issues 30-90 days ahead. Smart cost routing plus persistent memory means no more wasting tokens re-explaining context.

### Paragraph 3: What's Included
30+ production wizards for security, performance, testing, documentation, accessibility, and compliance. Agent toolkit to build custom agents that inherit memory, trust, and anticipation. Healthcare suite with HIPAA-compliant patterns. Works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, or your own models.

### Paragraph 4: Quick Start
Two commands to get started: `pip install empathy-framework` and `empathy-memory serve`. Redis starts, API server runs, memory system ready. Fair Source licensed—free for small teams, affordable for commercial use.

## Key Features (8 bullets)

1. **Persistent Memory** — Dual-layer architecture: git-based pattern storage (zero infrastructure, version-controlled), optional Redis for real-time coordination

2. **Local-First** — Your data stays on your infrastructure. Nothing leaves your control. Built-in compliance patterns for HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2

3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Empathy OS manages human↔AI and AI↔AI collaboration with trust management and conflict resolution

4. **Anticipatory Intelligence** — Predicts security vulnerabilities, performance degradation, and compliance gaps 30-90 days ahead

5. **Code Health Assistant** — One command (`empathy health`) runs lint, format, types, tests, security. Auto-fix safe issues. Track health scores over time with trend analysis.

6. **30+ Production Wizards** — Security, performance, testing, documentation, accessibility, compliance—use or extend

7. **Real Cost Savings** — Smart routing (cheap models triage, capable models decide) plus persistent memory eliminates repeated context

8. **Fair Source Licensed** — Free for teams ≤5 employees, contact us for pricing commercial, auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029

## First Comment (FINAL - v2.2.10)

**Title:** Hey Product Hunt! Here's why I built this.

---

I've been building AI tools for healthcare and software development. The frustration that drove me crazy? **Every AI session starts from zero.**

Your AI doesn't remember yesterday's architecture decisions. It doesn't know your team's bug patterns. When you fix a bug, that knowledge evaporates. Next month, someone hits the same issue and starts from scratch.

**So I built Empathy Framework.**

### What makes it different

**1. Memory that persists** — Git-based pattern storage means your AI learns across sessions. "This error looks like bug #247 from 3 months ago—here's what fixed it."

**2. Code inspection that correlates** — New in v2.2.10: `empathy-inspect` runs lint, security, tests, and tech debt analysis in one command. But here's the key—it correlates findings across tools. Security issue in a file with poor test coverage? Priority boost.

**3. Your data stays local** — Nothing leaves your infrastructure. Built-in PII scrubbing and audit logging. HIPAA/GDPR/SOC2 patterns included.

**4. Predictions, not reactions** — Anticipates issues 30-90 days ahead based on patterns in your codebase.

### Try it now

```bash
pip install empathy-framework
empathy-inspect .              # Unified code analysis
empathy-inspect . --format html  # Beautiful dashboard report
```

One command → health score, prioritized findings, GitHub Actions integration via SARIF.

### What's included

- **Code Inspection Pipeline** — Lint, security, tech debt, test quality in parallel
- **Memory-Enhanced Debugging** — "This looks like a bug we fixed before"
- **30+ Production Wizards** — Security, performance, testing, docs
- **Works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama** — Or your own models

### Pricing

- **Free** for students, educators, teams ≤5
- **contact us for pricing** commercial
- **Apache 2.0** auto-conversion in 2029

### I'd love feedback on:

1. What patterns should the memory system learn from your codebase?
2. CI/CD integration priorities? (GitHub Actions works now, GitLab/Azure next?)
3. What wizards should we build next?

Happy to answer questions! 🚀

## Response Templates

### Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT/Claude?
**A:** Those are stateless—they forget everything between sessions. Empathy adds persistent memory that learns across sessions, multi-agent coordination, anticipatory predictions, and local-first privacy. It's the infrastructure layer that makes AI tools enterprise-ready.

### Q: Does this work with my existing LLM provider?
**A:** Yes! Empathy works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API. The memory and orchestration layer sits on top of whatever LLM you choose.

### Q: What about privacy/security?
**A:** Local-first by design. Your data stays on your infrastructure. Built-in PII scrubbing, secrets detection, and audit logging. Compliance patterns for HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC2 included.

### Q: Why Fair Source instead of MIT/Apache?
**A:** Fair Source balances open access with sustainable development. Free forever for students, educators, and small teams. Commercial license funds continued development. And it auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029, so it will be fully open source in 4 years.

### Q: Can I contribute?
**A:** Yes! We welcome contributions. Check out the GitHub repo for contributing guidelines. Especially interested in new wizards, pattern libraries, and integrations.
