# Code Foresight - Positioning & Messaging

**Feature of:** Empathy Framework
**Status:** Core feature (not separate product)
**Created:** December 15, 2025

---

## Tagline

> **Code Foresight handles the tedious stuff—formatting, common bugs, stale patterns—so you focus on real problems. You stay in control; everything is configurable.**

---

## One-Liner Options

1. "Anticipatory code quality that learns your codebase"
2. "Your code's sixth sense"
3. "Institutional knowledge, automated"

---

## What It Is

Code Foresight is the practical payoff of Empathy Framework's memory system. It:

- **Learns** your codebase patterns (bugs, fixes, security decisions)
- **Anticipates** issues before they become problems
- **Automates** the tedious cleanup work
- **Respects** your control through deep configurability

---

## Entry Points (User Journey)

| Entry Point | Use Case | Command |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| VS Code startup | Resume after break | Auto-triggered session status |
| CLI scan | On-demand check | `empathy-foresight scan .` |
| Pre-commit hook | Catch before commit | Automatic via git hooks |
| Full analysis | Project review | `empathy-software analyze .` |

**Primary "aha moment":** VS Code startup after inactivity → session status report shows actionable items

---

## Differentiation

| Traditional Linters | Code Foresight |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Static rules | Learns YOUR patterns |
| Same for everyone | Adapts to YOUR codebase |
| Finds issues | Anticipates issues |
| Configuration = rules | Configuration = preferences |
| No memory | Remembers past bugs/fixes |

**Key differentiator:** ESLint tells you what's wrong. Code Foresight tells you what's *about* to go wrong—based on your project's history.

---

## Value Proposition

**For developers:**
- Less time on tedious cleanup
- Fewer "oops I forgot" commits
- Codebase knowledge persists (even when you forget)

**For teams:**
- Institutional knowledge captured automatically
- New team members inherit project patterns
- Consistent quality without constant review

---

## Messaging by Audience

**Claude Code power users:**
> "Code Foresight turns your CLAUDE.md and pattern storage into actionable intelligence. Open VS Code, see what needs attention, fix it before it becomes a problem."

**General developers:**
> "Ever come back to a project and forget where you left off? Code Foresight remembers. It tracks your patterns, anticipates issues, and shows you exactly what needs attention."

**Team leads:**
> "Stop losing institutional knowledge when developers switch projects. Code Foresight captures bug patterns, security decisions, and team conventions automatically."

## Demo Script (VS Code Startup)

1. Developer opens VS Code after 1+ hour away
2. Code Foresight triggers automatically
3. Session status report appears:
   ```
   Code Foresight Report
   =====================

   Since your last session:
   - 3 similar bugs detected (null reference pattern)
   - 1 security decision needs review
   - Tech debt increased: 2 new TODOs

   Recommended actions:
   1. [Fix] Null check in api/handler.py:42
   2. [Review] Security exception in auth.py
   3. [Consider] Refactor duplicate code in utils/
   ```
4. Developer clicks action → goes directly to issue
5. Pattern stored for next time

---

## Integration with Anthropic Cookbook

In the cookbook notebook, Code Foresight appears as:
- Section 10: "Claude Code Power Features"
- Shows how memory system enables practical automation
- Links pattern storage → actionable intelligence

## Planned Feature: End-of-Day Prep & Instant Morning Reports

**Problem:** Cold start—morning report takes time to generate.

**Solution:** Pre-compute overnight for instant morning experience.

### Triggers (User Choice)
1. **Manual command:** `empathy-foresight prep`
2. **Scheduled:** Cron/task scheduler (e.g., 6 PM daily)
3. **VS Code extension:** Auto-run on editor close

### What Prep Does
1. Run full Code Foresight analysis
2. Cache results in Redis (or local file)
3. Pre-generate morning report
4. Flag patterns needing attention
5. Optionally: Run auto-fixes (formatting cleanup)

### Morning Experience
```
Good morning! (Report generated 8 hours ago)

📚 Training Insight: [pre-computed]
📋 Today's Actions: [pre-computed]

⚡ Analysis took 0.1s (cached)
```

### Staleness Detection
- If code changed since prep (git status), show partial refresh
- Critical changes trigger fresh analysis
- Non-critical: use cache + delta

---

## Future Considerations

- VS Code extension (native integration, on-close prep)
- Team-shared pattern libraries
- CI/CD integration for PR reviews
- Analytics dashboard for pattern trends
