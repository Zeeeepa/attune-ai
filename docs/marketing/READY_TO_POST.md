## What's Ready

All files below contain ONLY verifiable claims. No time savings estimates, no "30-day studies", no unverified metrics.

### 1. Twitter Thread ✅
**File**: [TWITTER_THREAD_V3_9_3.md](TWITTER_THREAD_V3_9_3.md)

**8 tweets ready to copy-paste**:
- Tweet 1: Hook (teaching Claude, 174 tests, 0 vulnerabilities)
- Tweet 2: Problem (secured 6 modules, but pattern repeats)
- Tweet 3: Solution (1,170-line standards with real code)
- Tweet 4: Implementation (real code examples)
- Tweet 5: Results (verifiable metrics only)
- Tweet 6: How it works (automatic pattern following)
- Tweet 7: Guides (documentation links)
- Tweet 8: Try it yourself (step-by-step)

**Character counts**: All under 280
**Claims**: All verifiable in codebase

**Post**: Thursday, Jan 9, 9 AM EST

### 2. Campaign Plan ✅
**File**: [V3_9_3_CAMPAIGN.md](V3_9_3_CAMPAIGN.md)

**Contents**:
- Campaign overview (honest approach)
- Key messages (verifiable only)
- Platform strategy
- r/ClaudeAI post (ready)
- Response templates
- Launch timeline
- Success metrics (technical only)

**What we DON'T claim**:
❌ Specific time savings
❌ "30-day study"
❌ ROI percentages
❌ Adoption metrics

**What we DO share**:
✅ Technical achievements
✅ Verifiable metrics
✅ How-to guides
✅ Open source code

---

### 3. Response Templates ✅
**File**: [RESPONSE_TEMPLATES_ACCURATE.md](RESPONSE_TEMPLATES_ACCURATE.md)

**Pre-written responses for**:
- "This is just prompting"
- "What are your actual metrics?"
- "How much time does this save?"
- "174 tests seems excessive"
- "What about hallucinations?"
- "How do I implement this?"
- "This seems overhyped"
- "Security through obscurity?"
- And 15+ more

**All responses**: Honest, verifiable, humble

### 4. Visual Asset Guide ✅
**File**: [TWEET3_CODE_COMPARISON.md](TWEET3_CODE_COMPARISON.md)

**Options for code comparison visual**:
1. Text-based (quick, copy-paste)
2. Carbon.now.sh (5 min, professional)
3. Python script (automated)

**For**: Tweet 3 or Tweet 5

---

### 5. Automation Setup ✅
**File**: [AUTOMATION_SETUP.md](AUTOMATION_SETUP.md)

**Automated metrics tracking**:
- GitHub Actions workflow (already pushed)
- Runs daily at 9 AM UTC
- Auto-commits metrics
- Manual trigger available

**Current baseline** (verifiable):
- GitHub: 9 stars
- PyPI: 677 downloads/day, 4,970/month

---

### 6. Accuracy Audit ✅
**File**: [ACCURACY_AUDIT.md](ACCURACY_AUDIT.md)

**What's in this audit**:
- All inaccurate claims identified
- Why they're inaccurate
- What's verifiable vs. not
- Recommended fixes (completed)

**Use for**: Reference when writing new content

---

## What's Archived

Files with inaccurate claims moved to `archive/inaccurate_claims/`:
- ❌ TWITTER_THREAD_V3_9_1.md (had "30 days" claims)
- ❌ V3_9_1_CAMPAIGN.md (had unverified metrics)
- ❌ REDDIT_RESPONSE_TEMPLATES.md (had "tracked over 30 days")
- ❌ METRICS_TRACKING.md (manual template, superseded)

**Do not use these files.**

## Verifiable Metrics Reference

When asked for metrics, use these (all verifiable):

```
Empathy Framework v3.9.3:

Technical Facts:
🔒 174 security tests (v3.0 had 14)
📈 +1,143% increase in test coverage
🛡️ 0 current vulnerabilities
✅ 100/100 health score
📚 1,170-line coding standards reference
🎯 6 modules secured (CWE-22 path traversal)
🔬 Zero type errors in production code

All verifiable in:
github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy-framework
```

---

## What We Never Claim

❌ "Saves 80 hours/month" - Can't verify for users
❌ "Tracked over 30 days" - No controlled study
❌ "-62% violations" - Not precisely measured
❌ "-75% linter errors" - Not precisely measured
❌ "Guaranteed ROI" - Too context-dependent
❌ "Proven adoption" - Too early
❌ "Works with Copilot/Cursor" - Only tested with Claude Code

---

## What We Always Do

✅ Share what we built (code, tests, docs)
✅ Share what's verifiable (metrics in codebase)
✅ Explain how to implement (step-by-step guides)
✅ Let users evaluate for themselves

**Principle**: Honesty > hype
