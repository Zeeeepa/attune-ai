# Guerrilla Marketing Plan - Empathy Framework

**Created:** December 15, 2025
**Goal:** Organic visibility through developer communities

---

## Morning Session Tasks

### 1. Dev.to Article (30 min)
**Title:** "Give Claude Persistent Memory in 10 Lines of Python"

```markdown
Quick hook → Problem (stateless AI) → Solution (code snippet) → Link to docs
```

Draft outline:
- Hook: "Every conversation with Claude starts from scratch. Here's how to fix that."
- Show the 10-line snippet from the cookbook notebook
- Explain what's happening
- Link to PyPI and GitHub

### 2. Reddit Posts (20 min)

**r/ClaudeAI** - Most relevant audience
> "I built a persistent memory layer for Claude - here's a demo notebook"
> Link to cookbook notebook + PyPI

**r/Python** - Broader reach
> "empathy-framework: Add persistent memory to any LLM in Python"
> Focus on the clean API, not Claude-specific

**r/LocalLLaMA** - AI enthusiasts
> "Cross-session memory for LLMs - works with Claude, OpenAI, local models"

### 3. Twitter/X Thread (15 min)

```
1/ What if Claude remembered your preferences across sessions?

2/ I built @empaborat to give LLMs persistent memory.

pip install empathy-framework

3/ [Code screenshot showing basic usage]

4/ It tracks:
- User preferences
- Project context
- Conversation patterns

5/ Five empathy levels from reactive → anticipatory

6/ Now in Anthropic Cookbook: [link]

Full docs: smartaimemory.com
```

### 4. Hacker News Prep (save for cookbook merge)

**Title options:**
- "Show HN: Persistent memory for Claude (Python)"
- "Show HN: Empathy Framework – Give LLMs memory that survives sessions"

**Best time to post:** Tuesday/Wednesday 9-11am EST
