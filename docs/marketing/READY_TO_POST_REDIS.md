## TWITTER THREAD (Copy each tweet separately)

### Tweet 1 (Main - Post First)
```
We built an AI memory system. Here's why we chose Redis as the coordination layer.

New blog post: "Building Real-Time AI Memory with Redis"

Thread below

@Redisinc #Redis #AI #DevOps
```

### Tweet 2
```
The problem: AI tools are stateless.

Every conversation starts from zero. No memory of yesterday's decisions. No coordination between agents.

We needed a memory layer. Fast. Simple. Battle-tested.
```

### Tweet 3
```
Why Redis?

We tested PostgreSQL (~10ms), MongoDB (~5ms), SQLite (<1ms but no coordination).

Redis won:
- Sub-millisecond latency
- Simple key-value model
- Pub/sub built-in
- Battle-tested
```

### Tweet 4
```
Our architecture:

Layer 1: Git-based patterns (long-term knowledge)
Layer 2: Redis (real-time coordination)

Git for persistence. Redis for speed.

Students use just git. Teams add Redis.
```

### Tweet 5
```
4 Redis use cases in our system:

1. Session context storage (instant access, auto-expiration)
2. Multi-agent coordination (task claiming, result sharing)
3. Real-time notifications (pub/sub for agent events)
4. Short-term memory (conversation context)
```

### Tweet 6
```
Performance results:

Session read: 0.3ms
Agent coordination: 0.4ms
Pub/sub message: 0.1ms
Memory retrieval: 0.5ms

Redis is fast enough that it doesn't impact AI response latency.

Building Real-Time AI Memory with Redis

We've been building AI collaboration tools for the past year. The biggest challenge? AI tools are stateless. Every conversation starts from zero.

So we built a memory system. And we chose Redis as the coordination layer.

Why Redis?

We needed sub-millisecond latency for real-time AI decisions. We evaluated PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. Redis won because:

- <1ms latency for agent coordination
- Simple key-value model that maps naturally to memory contexts
- Pub/sub built-in for instant agent notifications
- Battle-tested in production at scale

Our Architecture

We built a dual-layer memory system:

1. Git-based pattern storage — Long-term knowledge (bug patterns, security decisions, team learnings). Version-controlled, zero infrastructure for individuals.

2. Redis — Real-time coordination for active sessions. What agents are working on, shared context, instant notifications.

Students can use the framework with just git. Teams add Redis for multi-agent coordination.

Performance Results

- Session context read: 0.3ms
- Agent coordination write: 0.4ms
- Pub/sub message: 0.1ms
- Memory context retrieval: 0.5ms

Redis is fast enough that it adds <1ms overhead to AI interactions. The LLM call dominates at 100-2000ms.

The Insight

Redis isn't just for caching anymore. It's the perfect fit for real-time AI coordination:
- Fast enough for real-time decisions
- Simple enough for quick integration
- Powerful enough for multi-agent systems
