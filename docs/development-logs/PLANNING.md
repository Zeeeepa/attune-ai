  - Blog post ready: `/website/content/blog/memory-architecture.mdx`

### Completed This Session
- [x] Redis auto-bootstrap (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- [x] Memory Control Panel (CLI + Python API)
- [x] Cross-platform support (Homebrew, systemd, Chocolatey, Scoop, WSL, Docker)
- [x] Blog post on memory architecture
- [x] README restructured for HN (104 lines)
- [x] Plausible analytics added

## Mid-Term (1-6 Weeks)

### Memory Dashboard GUIs

#### 1. Web Dashboard (FastAPI + Vue)
**Priority: HIGH** - Enterprise customers need this

```
Features:
├── Real-time Redis metrics (WebSocket)
├── Pattern browser with search/filter
├── Classification visualization (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/SENSITIVE)
├── User access management
├── Audit log viewer
├── Export/import tools
└── Multi-tenant support
```

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI + WebSocket
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
- Charts: Chart.js or Apache ECharts
- Auth: JWT + optional OIDC

#### 2. Desktop App (PyQt/PySide)
**Priority: MEDIUM** - Air-gapped/offline environments

```
Features:
├── Native system tray icon
├── Redis status indicator
├── Quick pattern search
├── Local-only mode
├── Auto-start with system
└── Cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux)
```

**Tech Stack:**
- PySide6 (LGPL, commercial-friendly)
- QML for modern UI
- PyInstaller for distribution

#### 3. VS Code Extension Panel
**Priority: HIGH** - Developers live here

```
Features:
├── Sidebar panel with memory status
├── Quick actions (start Redis, view patterns)
├── Pattern preview on hover
├── Integration with existing Empathy extension
└── Command palette commands
```

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript
- VS Code Webview API
- Communicate with Python backend via HTTP/WebSocket

### Other Mid-Term Goals

- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Get from 14% to 80%
- [ ] **Documentation Site** - Proper docs with examples
- [ ] **Video Tutorials** - Quick start, memory system, enterprise setup
- [ ] **Discord/Slack Community** - User support channel

---

## Long-Term (6+ Weeks)

### Product Evolution
- [ ] **SaaS Offering** - Hosted Empathy for teams who don't want to self-host
- [ ] **Enterprise Features**
  - SSO integration (SAML, OIDC)
  - Role-based access control UI
  - Compliance reports (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR)
  - Centralized pattern library across teams
- [ ] **Mobile Companion App** - View patterns, receive alerts

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Remove MemDocs as separate project (integrated into Empathy)
- [ ] Consolidate wizard implementations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and optimization

### Partnerships
- [ ] Anthropic partnership/showcase
- [ ] Integration with popular tools (Notion, Linear, Jira)
- [ ] Healthcare vendor partnerships

---

## Ongoing Processes

### Weekly
- [ ] Reddit/HN engagement
- [ ] GitHub issue triage
- [ ] Analytics review

### Monthly
- [ ] PyPI release
- [ ] Blog post
- [ ] Outreach to potential enterprise customers

### Quarterly
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Dependency updates

## GUI Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: VS Code Panel (Week 1-2)
Fastest to ship, immediate value for developers.

```
src/
└── vscode-extension/
    └── webview/
        ├── MemoryPanel.ts
        ├── MemoryPanel.html
        └── styles.css
```

### Phase 2: Web Dashboard MVP (Week 3-4)
Basic dashboard for enterprise demos.

```
dashboard/
├── backend/
│   ├── main.py (FastAPI)
│   ├── websocket.py
│   └── api/
│       ├── memory.py
│       ├── patterns.py
│       └── auth.py
└── frontend/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   ├── views/
    │   └── stores/
    └── package.json
```

### Phase 3: Desktop App (Week 5-6)
Native experience for power users.

```
desktop/
├── main.py
├── ui/
│   ├── main_window.py
│   ├── tray_icon.py
│   └── qml/
│       ├── Dashboard.qml
│       └── PatternBrowser.qml
└── build/
    ├── macos/
    ├── windows/
    └── linux/
```

## Notes

- **MemDocs terminology**: Use "long-term memory" / "short-term memory" instead
- **Target audience**: Enterprise developers, healthcare IT, financial services
- **Key differentiator**: Privacy-first, user-controlled, works offline
