## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

**CacheAnalyzer** is a comprehensive cache performance analysis system that evaluates cache effectiveness and provides actionable recommendations for optimization. It works in conjunction with the `CacheMonitor` system to deliver insights into cache health, hit rates, and resource utilization.

#### What is CacheAnalyzer?

CacheAnalyzer analyzes cache performance metrics and translates raw statistics into meaningful health assessments. It evaluates:

- **Hit rate effectiveness** — How often cached data is successfully retrieved
- **Request patterns** — Volume and distribution of cache operations
- **Resource utilization** — Memory usage and capacity constraints
- **Confidence levels** — Statistical significance of the analysis

#### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Performance Optimization** | Identify underperforming caches that waste resources |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Detect memory pressure and capacity issues before they impact performance |
| **Actionable Insights** | Receive specific recommendations tailored to each cache's behavior |
| **Data-Driven Decisions** | Make informed choices about cache configuration and strategy |

#### When to Use This API

- **Monitoring Phase** — Regular health checks during production operation
- **Debugging Phase** — Investigate performance bottlenecks and cache misses
- **Optimization Phase** — Evaluate the impact of cache tuning and configuration changes
- **Capacity Planning** — Assess whether caches need resizing or restructuring

### 1.2 Quick Start

#### Installation Requirements

```python
# Required imports
from attune.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer, CacheHealthScore
from attune.cache_monitor import CacheMonitor
```

> **Prerequisites:** Ensure `CacheMonitor` is properly initialized and tracking your caches before using `CacheAnalyzer`. The analyzer reads statistics from the `CacheMonitor` singleton instance.

#### Basic Usage

```python
from attune.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer

# Analyze a specific cache
health = CacheAnalyzer.analyze_cache("my_cache")

if health:
    print(f"Cache health: {health.health} ({health.hit_rate:.1%} hit rate)")
    print(f"Recommendation: {health.recommendation}")
else:
    print("Cache not found")
```

#### Minimal Working Example (5 Lines)

```python
from attune.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer

analyzer = CacheAnalyzer()
health = analyzer.analyze_cache("my_cache")
print(f"Cache health: {health.health} ({health.hit_rate:.1%} hit rate)")
```

### 1.3 Core Concepts

#### Cache Health Scoring Methodology

CacheAnalyzer uses a multi-dimensional scoring system that considers:

1. **Hit Rate** — Primary indicator of cache effectiveness (0.0 to 1.0)
2. **Request Volume** — Number of total requests (affects confidence level)
3. **Utilization** — Memory usage relative to maximum capacity

**Health Categories:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `excellent` | Cache is highly effective, delivering strong performance |
| `good` | Cache is working well with room for improvement |
| `fair` | Cache provides moderate benefit but may need attention |
| `poor` | Cache is ineffective and may be wasting resources |

#### Confidence Levels

Confidence indicates the statistical reliability of the health assessment based on request volume:

| Confidence | Request Count | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| `low` | < 10 requests | Limited data; assessment may change significantly |
| `medium` | 10–99 requests | Moderate data; trends are emerging |
| `high` | ≥ 100 requests | Strong data; assessment is reliable |

**Confidence-Adjusted Health Thresholds:**

| Confidence | Excellent | Good | Fair | Poor |
|------------|-----------|------|------|------|
| `low` | ≥ 80% | ≥ 60% | < 60% | — |
| `medium` | ≥ 70% | ≥ 50% | ≥ 30% | < 30% |
| `high` | ≥ 60% | ≥ 40% | ≥ 20% | < 20% |

> **Note:** Low-confidence assessments do not assign a `poor` rating because insufficient data makes such judgments unreliable.

#### Hit Rate Interpretation

Hit rate is the ratio of cache hits to total requests:

```python
hit_rate = cache_hits / (cache_hits + cache_misses)
```

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

| Hit Rate | Assessment | Recommended Action |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| > 70% | Strong | Monitor and maintain |
| 50–70% | Moderate | Consider optimization |
| 20–50% | Weak | Review cache strategy |
| < 20% | Poor | Consider disabling or redesigning |
