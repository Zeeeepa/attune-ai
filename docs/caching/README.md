# Caching Documentation

Complete guide to Empathy Framework's intelligent response caching system (v3.8.0+).

## 📚 Documentation Index

### 🚀 [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
**Start here for common scenarios and quick answers.**

One-page reference covering:
- Common use cases with code examples
- Cache type comparison table
- Decision tree for choosing cache type
- Performance numbers and cost savings
- Troubleshooting guide

**Read this if:** You want quick answers and code snippets.

---

### ⚙️ [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md)
**Comprehensive guide to caching configuration.**

Detailed coverage of:
- Hash-only vs Hybrid cache selection
- When to enable/disable caching
- Configuration options (TTL, similarity threshold)
- Per-workflow configuration
- Cache maintenance and monitoring
- Performance benchmarks

**Read this if:** You want to understand all configuration options and make informed decisions.

---

### 🧠 [Adaptive Workflows](ADAPTIVE_WORKFLOWS.md)
**Understanding deterministic vs adaptive workflow behavior.**

In-depth explanation of:
- Workflow types (deterministic vs adaptive)
- The "Caching Paradox" - why adaptive workflows may cost more with cache
- Real-world Security Audit example
- Workflow classification table (12 workflows)
- When to use each approach
- Best practices for each type

**Read this if:** You noticed Run 2 costing more than Run 1 and want to understand why, or you're writing about caching for educational purposes.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Default Setup (Recommended)

```python
from empathy_os.workflows import CodeReviewWorkflow

# That's it! Framework handles cache setup automatically
workflow = CodeReviewWorkflow(enable_cache=True)
result = await workflow.execute(diff=my_diff)

# Check cache effectiveness
print(f"Cache hit rate: {result.cost_report.cache_hit_rate:.1f}%")
print(f"Savings: ${result.cost_report.savings_from_cache:.4f}")
```

### Explicit Cache Configuration

```python
from empathy_os.cache import create_cache
from empathy_os.workflows import SecurityAuditWorkflow

# Create cache instance
cache = create_cache(cache_type="hash")  # or "hybrid"

# Use with workflow
workflow = SecurityAuditWorkflow(cache=cache, enable_cache=True)
result = await workflow.execute(target_path="./src")
```

## 📊 Performance at a Glance

| Cache Type | Lookup Time | Memory | Hit Rate (Identical) | Hit Rate (Similar) |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Hash-only  | ~5μs        | <1MB   | 100%                 | 0%                |
| Hybrid     | ~100ms      | ~500MB | 100%                 | 70-90%            |

**Cost Savings (v3.8.0 benchmarks):**
- Without cache: $0.856/run (12 workflows)
- With cache: $0.428/run (50% savings on repeated runs)

## 🧪 Testing Caching

### Quick Test (2-3 minutes)

```bash
python benchmark_caching_simple.py
```

Tests 2 workflows (code-review, security-audit) to verify cache is working.

### Full Benchmark (15-20 minutes)

```bash
python benchmark_caching.py
```

Tests all 12 production workflows and generates comprehensive report.

## 📁 Cache Storage

**Location:** `~/.empathy/cache/responses.json`

```bash
# View cache size
du -h ~/.empathy/cache/responses.json

# Clear cache
rm ~/.empathy/cache/responses.json

# Backup cache
cp ~/.empathy/cache/responses.json ~/.empathy/cache/responses.backup
```

## 🔧 Installation

### Hash-Only Cache (Default)

No additional installation required - included with Empathy Framework.

```bash
pip install empathy-framework
```

### Hybrid Cache (Semantic Matching)

Install ML dependencies:

```bash
# Recommended: Install with cache extra
pip install empathy-framework[cache]

# Or install dependencies separately
pip install sentence-transformers torch
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Hash-Only Cache
- **How it works:** SHA256 hash of prompt → exact match lookup
- **Best for:** CI/CD, testing, batch processing with identical inputs
- **Pros:** Fast (~5μs), zero dependencies, 100% hit rate on exact matches
- **Cons:** 0% hit rate on different prompts

### Hybrid Cache
- **How it works:** Hash lookup first, then semantic similarity search
- **Best for:** Development, production with similar prompts
- **Pros:** 70-90% hit rate on similar prompts, significant cost savings
- **Cons:** Slower (~100ms), requires ML dependencies, higher memory

### Adaptive Workflows
- **How it works:** Adjust execution based on findings (e.g., deeper analysis on critical issues)
- **Cache behavior:** May use more PREMIUM tier on Run 2 (smarter analysis)
- **Examples:** Security Audit, Bug Prediction, Performance Audit
- **Key insight:** Run 2 costing more is a FEATURE (better analysis), not a bug

### Deterministic Workflows
- **How it works:** Always execute same stages with same tiers
- **Cache behavior:** Run 2 costs ≤ Run 1 (predictable savings)
- **Examples:** Code Review, Test Generation, Document Generation
- **Key insight:** 100% cache hit rate on repeated runs

## 📈 Real-World Impact

### Scenario: Active Development Team

- 20 security audits
- 30 code reviews
- 10 performance audits

**Without cache:**

- Monthly cost: ~$450

**With hybrid cache (70% hit rate):**
- Daily cost: ~$5
- Monthly cost: ~$150
- **Annual savings: ~$3,600**

### Scenario: CI/CD Pipeline

**Daily usage:**

- Monthly cost: ~$75
- **Annual savings: ~$900**
