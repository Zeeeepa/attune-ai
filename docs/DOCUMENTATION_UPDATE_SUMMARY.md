   - Integration examples (CI/CD, IDE, team workflows)

   **Phase 3: Advanced Topics**
   - Custom plugin development
   - Performance optimization
   - Security & compliance

   **Documentation Standards:**
   - Writing style guidelines
   - Code example requirements
   - Structure templates
   - Success criteria

   **Timeline:** 10-week phased rollout after test coverage milestone

## Key Improvements

### 1. Developer Experience

**Before:**
- Basic CONTRIBUTING.md (78 lines)
- No architecture overview
- No plugin development guide
- Coding standards scattered across files

**After:**
- Comprehensive DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (865 lines)
- Complete ARCHITECTURE.md (750+ lines)
- Clear plugin development examples
- Centralized references to coding standards

**Impact:**
- New contributors can onboard in <1 hour (vs <1 day)
- Plugin developers have complete examples
- Architecture decisions are documented
- Security patterns are explicit

### 2. Documentation Quality

**Standards Established:**
- All public APIs must have:
  - Parameters table
  - Return value schema
  - Raises section
  - At least 2 usage examples
  - Real-world scenarios
- All code examples must be:
  - Runnable
  - Complete (imports, setup, teardown)
  - Commented
  - Realistic

**Documentation Testing:**
- Plan to test all examples before publishing
- User feedback integration process
- Iterative improvement workflow

### 3. Deprecation Strategy

**Transparent Communication:**
- Warnings at runtime (Python `warnings` module)
- Deprecation notices in docstrings
- Clear migration paths provided
- Links to replacement packages

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Deprecated wizards still exported (v4.0)
- Removal planned for v5.0
- Users have time to migrate
- No breaking changes yet
