# Attune AI — Case Studies & ROI Scenarios

**For:** Business development, enterprise sales, partnership discussions

---

## Case Study 1: Enterprise Engineering Team

### Scenario
A 50-developer engineering team at a mid-size SaaS company spends significant time on:
- Code reviews (avg 2 hours/developer/week)

- Documentation maintenance

### Implementation
Deployed Attune AI with:
- SecurityWizard for continuous scanning
- CodeReviewWizard for automated first-pass reviews
- BugPredictWizard for proactive issue detection
- Smart model routing to optimize costs

### Results (Projected)

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Code review time | 100 hrs/week | 40 hrs/week | **60% reduction** |
| Bugs found in production | 15/month | 5/month | **67% reduction** |
| Security findings (quarterly) | 25 critical | 8 critical | **68% reduction** |
| AI API costs | $5,000/month | $800/month | **84% savings** |

### ROI Calculation

**Annual savings:**
- Developer time: 3,120 hours × $75/hr = **$234,000**
- Reduced bug fixes: 120 bugs × 4 hrs × $75/hr = **$36,000**
- API cost savings: $50,400/year = **$50,400**
- **Total: $320,400/year**

**Investment:** Commercial license + setup
**Payback period:** < 2 months

## ROI Calculator

### Input Variables
```
Team size:           _____ developers
Average hourly rate: $_____ /hour
Current AI spend:    $_____ /month
Bug fix time:        _____ hours/bug
Bugs per month:      _____
Code review time:    _____ hours/week/dev
```

### Projected Savings Formula

**Developer Time Savings:**
```
Code review: (current_hours × 0.60) × hourly_rate × 52 weeks
Bug prevention: (bugs × 0.67) × fix_hours × hourly_rate × 12 months
```

**AI Cost Savings:**
```
(current_ai_spend × 0.85) × 12 months
```

**Total Annual ROI:**
```
Time savings + AI savings - License cost
```

### Quick Estimates by Team Size

| Team Size | Est. Annual Savings | License Cost | Net ROI |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| 1-5 devs | $15,000-$40,000 | $0 (Free) | $15,000-$40,000 |
| 10 devs | $80,000-$120,000 | Contact us | High |
| 25 devs | $180,000-$250,000 | Contact us | High |
| 50 devs | $300,000-$450,000 | Contact us | High |
| 100 devs | $600,000-$900,000 | Contact us | High |

## Key Value Drivers

### 1. Cost Reduction (80-96%)
Smart model routing ensures you're not paying premium prices for simple tasks.

**Example:**
- Without routing: 1M tokens/day × $15/1M (Opus) = $15/day = **$450/month**
- With routing: 70% Haiku + 25% Sonnet + 5% Opus = **$72/month**
- **Savings: 84%**

### 2. Bug Prevention (50-70%)
Anticipatory intelligence catches issues before they reach production.

**Cost of production bug:** $5,000-$50,000 (depending on severity)
**Cost of caught bug:** $50-$200 (developer time to review alert)

### 3. Developer Velocity (+20-30%)
AI assistants that remember context eliminate repetitive explanations.

**Before:** Re-explain codebase architecture every session
**After:** Memory recalls patterns, decisions, and context automatically

### 4. Compliance Acceleration (80%+)
Built-in audit trails and security scanning reduce compliance burden.

**Before:** 2-week audit prep scramble
**After:** Always audit-ready with continuous logging
