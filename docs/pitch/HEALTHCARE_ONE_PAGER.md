# Attune AI for Healthcare
## HIPAA-Ready AI Development Tools

---

## The Opportunity

**Claude for Healthcare launched January 2026** — Anthropic is investing heavily in compliant AI for healthcare and life sciences.

**Attune AI is already HIPAA-ready**, providing the development infrastructure healthcare organizations need to build secure, compliant AI applications.

---

## Why Healthcare Needs Empathy

| Challenge | Current State | With Empathy |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **PHI in Development** | Developers accidentally expose patient data in prompts | Automatic PII scrubbing before any LLM call |
| **Audit Requirements** | Manual logging, incomplete trails | Built-in audit logging of all AI interactions |
| **Security Scanning** | Periodic manual reviews | Continuous OWASP scanning with healthcare rules |
| **Compliance Documentation** | Scramble before audits | Always audit-ready with exportable logs |
| **AI Cost Management** | Unpredictable, high costs | 80-96% reduction via smart routing |

---

## HIPAA Technical Safeguards Alignment

### Access Controls (§164.312(a))
- Role-based wizard access
- Audit trail of all operations
- Session isolation

### Audit Controls (§164.312(b))
- Comprehensive logging of LLM interactions
- Exportable audit reports
- Retention policy compliance

### Integrity Controls (§164.312(c))
- Input validation on all operations
- No eval/exec vulnerabilities
- Path traversal protection

### Transmission Security (§164.312(e))
- HTTPS-only API communication
- No PHI in logs or telemetry
- PII scrubbing at ingestion

---

## Built-in PII Protection

```python
from attune.security import PIIScrubber

scrubber = PIIScrubber()

# Before sending to LLM
safe_prompt = scrubber.scrub("""
    Patient John Smith (DOB: 03/15/1985, SSN: 123-45-6789)
    presented with symptoms...
""")

# Result: "Patient [REDACTED] (DOB: [REDACTED], SSN: [REDACTED])
#          presented with symptoms..."
```

**Detected PHI types:**
- Names, DOBs, SSNs
- Medical record numbers
- Phone numbers, addresses
- Email addresses
- Custom patterns (configurable)

---

## Healthcare-Specific Workflows

### 1. HIPAA Security Scan
```bash
empathy workflow run security-scan --hipaa-mode
```
- OWASP Top 10 + healthcare-specific checks
- PHI exposure detection
- Access control validation

### 2. Clinical Code Review
```bash
empathy workflow run code-review --compliance=hipaa
```
- PHI handling verification
- Audit logging completeness
- Encryption at rest/in transit checks

### 3. Compliance Documentation
```bash
empathy workflow run doc-gen --template=hipaa-controls
```
- Auto-generate control documentation
- Map code to safeguard requirements
- Export for auditor review

## Integration with Claude for Healthcare

Attune AI complements Claude for Healthcare by providing:

| Claude for Healthcare | Attune AI |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Clinical AI models | Development infrastructure |
| PubMed/CMS integration | Code security & compliance |
| Patient-facing AI | Developer-facing tools |
| HIPAA-compliant inference | HIPAA-compliant development |

**Together:** End-to-end compliant AI development and deployment for healthcare.

---

## Cost Savings in Healthcare

Healthcare organizations face unique AI cost pressures:
- High volume of clinical documentation
- Complex reasoning for diagnostic support
- 24/7 availability requirements

**Empathy's smart routing delivers:**

| Use Case | Without Empathy | With Empathy | Savings |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| Clinical note summarization | $3,000/month | $450/month | 85% |
| Diagnostic assistance | $8,000/month | $1,200/month | 85% |
| Patient communication | $2,000/month | $200/month | 90% |
