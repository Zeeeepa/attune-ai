# Attune AI
## AI That Anticipates Problems Before They Happen

---

### The Problem

**AI coding assistants are reactive, not proactive.**

- Developers spend 30-50% of time on preventable bugs, security issues, and technical debt
- Current AI tools wait for problems—they don't predict them
- Enterprise teams lack memory continuity across AI sessions
- Multi-agent orchestration requires deep expertise to implement correctly

---

### The Solution

**Attune AI: Production-ready anticipatory intelligence for software development**

A 5-level maturity model that progresses AI from reactive responses to predicting problems before they happen—with persistent memory that learns your codebase over time.

| Level | Capability | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Reactive | "Here's the fix you asked for" |
| 2 | Guided | "What language? What framework?" |
| 3 | Proactive | "I noticed 3 similar bugs—want me to fix them?" |
| 4 | **Anticipatory** | "This pattern typically causes issues in 2 weeks" |
| 5 | Transformative | "I've restructured to prevent this class of bugs" |

---

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Cost Reduction** | 80-96% via intelligent model routing |
| **Smart Wizards** | 10 (security, testing, docs, performance...) |
| **Integrated Workflows** | 14 (including 4 meta-workflows) |
| **Agent Templates** | 7 with 6 composition patterns |
| **Test Coverage** | 125+ tests, production-stable |
| **Version** | v4.4.0 (January 2026) |
