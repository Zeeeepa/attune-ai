# Empathy Framework — Executive Summary

**One-liner:** AI that predicts problems before they happen, with memory that learns your codebase.

## The Pitch (Email-Ready)

Empathy Framework is a production-ready anticipatory intelligence platform that transforms AI coding assistants from reactive tools into proactive partners. Our 5-level maturity model progresses AI from simply answering questions to predicting bugs, security vulnerabilities, and technical debt before they impact your team—reducing preventable issues by up to 50%.

**Key differentiators:**
- **80-96% cost reduction** via intelligent model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
- **Persistent memory** that learns your codebase across sessions
- **10 smart wizards** for security, testing, documentation, and more
- **HIPAA-ready** with built-in PII scrubbing and audit logging

We're seeking strategic partnership with the Anthropic ecosystem to scale enterprise adoption and deepen Claude integration. The framework is open source (Fair Source License), production-stable at v4.4.0, and optimized for Claude Code workflows.
