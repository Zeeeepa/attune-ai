# Authentic Story Builder: What Really Happened?

**Purpose:** Figure out YOUR real story so we can tell it authentically across all platforms.

No fabrications. No drama. Just what actually happened.

---

## 🎯 Questions to Answer (For Yourself)

### **1. What Actually Prompted This?**

Think back to when you first decided to track Claude API costs. What was the real trigger?

Pick the one that's TRUE (or write your own):

- [ ] A. I was working on Attune AI and noticed the API calls piling up
- [ ] B. I just got curious about where the money was going
- [ ] C. Someone (co-founder/friend/partner) asked "what are we paying for?"
- [ ] D. I saw the bill and thought "huh, is this optimized?"
- [X] E. It just seemed like something worth measuring
- [ ] F. Other: ________________________________

**Your actual answer:**

---

### **2. When Did This Happen?**

Based on our data, tests ran on Jan 9, 2026. Working backwards:

- When did you START tracking? I started tracking usage costs closely after trying to return to work after having to stop.
- When did you NOTICE you wanted to optimize? When the cost of my tech stack got to be more than $300.
- Was this gradual curiosity or a specific moment? Mostly, I'm on a fixed budget these days and I have to keep an eye on expenses.

**Your timeline:**

---

### **3. What Made It "Bug" You?**

You're intellectually curious and easily bored. But what specifically about the Claude costs caught your attention?

- [x ] A. Didn't understand where money was going
- [x ] B. Suspected inefficiency but had no proof
- [ ] C. Wanted to know if I was using the right models
- [x ] D. Just seemed like an interesting optimization problem
- [ ] E. Nothing better to do that day
- [ ] F. Other: ________________________________

**Your actual reason:**

---

### **4. What Was Your First Attempt?**

We know the SECOND attempt worked (Sonnet→Opus fallback). But what did you try FIRST?

- [x ] A. Manual routing ("if complex, use Opus")
- [ ] B. Just kept using Opus for everything
- [ ] C. Tried to build a complexity scorer
- [ ] D. Looked at the pricing page and felt confused
- [ x] E. Started adding telemetry to see what was happening
- [ ] F. Other: ________________________________

**What actually happened first:**

---

### **5. What Surprised You Most?**

Looking at the results (100% Sonnet success, 0% fallback), what genuinely surprised you?

- [ x] A. That Sonnet worked for security reviews
- [ ] B. That I never needed Opus at all
- [ ] C. That the implementation was so simple
- [ x] D. That I'd been overpaying this whole time
- [ ] E. How much data I needed to analyze (873 calls!)
- [ ] F. Other: __I still think I need Opus 4.5 for architectural reviews and it should be used by the fallback approach.______________________________

**Your honest surprise:**

---

### **6. Why Are You Sharing This?**

Genuine question - why post about this publicly?

- [ x] A. Spent too much time on it not to share
- [ x] B. Thought it might help others
- [ ] C. Curious if others track costs this way
- [x ] D. Want feedback on the approach
- [X ] E. It's interesting and I like sharing interesting things
- [ ] F. Other: __I need to do this to keep productive. I don't like the idea of going to rot because I don't keep my brain in shape.______________________________

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Remove

If you see these in your draft, delete them:

- ❌ "Three months in a row" (not in your data)
- ❌ "$25/month" (it was $25.39 total for 30 days)
- ❌ Any timeline you can't verify
- ❌ Any emotion you didn't actually feel
- ❌ Any dramatic "moment" that didn't happen
- ❌ Any conversation you didn't have

---

## ✅ Green Flags to Keep

These make it authentic:

- ✅ "I'm not sure if..." (honest uncertainty)
- ✅ Specific dates/times you remember
- ✅ "Honestly didn't expect..." (genuine surprise)
- ✅ Questions you genuinely have
- ✅ Mistakes you actually made
- ✅ "This might be overthinking it" (self-awareness)

---

## 💡 The Ultimate Test

**Before posting, ask yourself:**

1. Did this actually happen? (Yes/No)
2. Is this how I actually think about it? (Yes/No)
3. Would someone who knows me recognize my voice? (Yes/No)

**If all three are "Yes" → Post it**

**If any are "No" → Keep editing**

---

## 📊 Your Real Data (For Reference)

Use ONLY these facts:

```
Period: 30 days (approximately Jan 3 - Feb 2, 2026)
Total calls: 873
Total cost: $25.39

Anthropic:
- Calls: 438
- Cost: $12.78

After optimization:
- Sonnet success: 100%
- Opus fallback: 0%
- Projected savings: $211/year
- Actual savings: 77.6%

Test date: Jan 9, 2026
Test results: 5/5 passed with Sonnet
```

Everything else needs to come from YOUR memory of what actually happened.

## 🎤 Final Advice

The best stories aren't the most dramatic.

They're the most honest.

Your "retired but curious" angle is already interesting. You don't need fake drama.

Just tell what actually happened. That's compelling enough.
