# Announcing Attune AI: Cut Your LLM Costs by 34-86% While Supercharging Developer Workflows

**Stop overpaying for AI-powered development. Attune AI brings intelligent cost optimization to your coding workflows.**

---

If you've been using AI assistants for development, you've probably noticed the costs adding up. Every code review, every debugging session, every test generation—they all consume tokens. And not every task needs the most expensive model.

That's a reason we built **Attune AI**.

## What is Attune AI?

Attune AI is an open-source framework that brings AI-powered workflows to your terminal and Claude Code—with built-in intelligence about *which* model to use for *which* task.

```bash
pip install attune-ai[developer]
```

Instead of sending everything to the most capable (and expensive) model, Attune AI automatically routes tasks to the right tier:

| Task Type | Model Tier | Typical Cost |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Formatting, simple fixes | Haiku (cheap) | ~$0.005 |
| Bug fixes, code review | Sonnet (capable) | ~$0.08 |
| Architecture, complex design | Opus (premium) | ~$0.45 |

The result? **34-86% cost savings** without sacrificing quality where it matters.

## Smart Authentication Strategy

Attune AI intelligently routes between your Claude subscription and the Anthropic API based on what makes sense for each task:

```bash
# Small/medium modules (<2000 LOC) → Claude subscription (free)
# Large modules (>2000 LOC) → Anthropic API (pay for context you need)
```

Most everyday workflows—debugging, commits, code review, test running—work through your existing Claude subscription. When you're analyzing large files that require extended context, Attune AI automatically routes to the API to give you the analysis depth you need.

```bash
# Set it up once
python -m attune.models.auth_cli setup
```

## Command Hubs: Everything Organized

Attune AI organizes workflows into intuitive command hubs:

- **`/dev`** — Developer tools: debugging, commits, PRs, code review
- **`/testing`** — Test running, coverage analysis, batch test generation
- **`/workflows`** — Automated analysis: security audits, bug prediction, performance
- **`/plan`** — Planning, TDD strategies, refactoring approaches
- **`/docs`** — Documentation generation and management
- **`/release`** — Release prep, security scanning, publishing

Natural language works too:

```bash
/workflows "find security vulnerabilities"  # → runs security-audit
/plan "review my code"                      # → runs code-review
```

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

For complex tasks, Attune AI coordinates multiple specialized agents:

- **Agent Coordination Dashboard** — Real-time monitoring of agent workflows
- **6 Coordination Patterns** — Heartbeats, signals, events, approvals, quality feedback, demo mode
- **Custom Agents** — Build specialized agents for your specific needs

```bash
# Launch the dashboard
python examples/dashboard_demo.py
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Built for Security

We take security seriously:

- **Path traversal protection** on all file operations
- **Input sanitization** before any code analysis
- **Sandboxed execution** — no arbitrary code runs in workflows
- **Secrets detection** via pre-commit hooks
- **HIPAA/GDPR compliance options** for healthcare and enterprise

## Get Started in 2 Minutes

1. **Install**

```bash
pip install attune-ai[developer]
```

2. **Configure**

```bash
python -m attune.models.auth_cli setup
```

3. **Use**

```bash
# In Claude Code
/dev debug "authentication fails on login"
/testing coverage --target 90
/workflows "find security issues"

# Or via CLI
attune workflow run security-audit --path ./src
attune telemetry savings --days 30
```

## Why Open Source?

We believe developer tools should be transparent, extensible, and community-driven. Attune AI is licensed under **Apache 2.0**—use it, modify it, build commercial products with it.
