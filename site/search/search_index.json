A: Yes! Every framework user sees Claude as the recommended provider. Many start with free tier (their own API key) but upgrade to Pro (Claude included) for convenience and optimization.</p> <p>Q: What if Claude API pricing changes? A: Our multi-provider architecture means we can adjust: - Shift default to more cost-effective models - Pass reasonable increases to users - Negotiate volume discounts with Anthropic - Users always have choice</p> <p>Q: How do Claude-specific features work with other providers?

The CICDWizard runs standard analysis, but then something unique happens.</p> <p>Cross-domain pattern detection activates. The framework retrieves the healthcare pattern and finds an exact match in our deployment code.</p> <p>Look at this: same handoff gaps. No verification checklist. Assumptions about the receiving team. Time pressure. Verbal-only communication.</p> <p>Now watch the Level 4 Anticipatory prediction. Based on the healthcare pattern, the framework predicts an 87% chance of deployment failure within 30 to 45 days.</p> <p>And it doesn't just predict the problem.

Creator here. Let me explain why I built this.</p> <p>Content:</p> <p>I've been working in healthcare AI and noticed something fascinating: healthcare has spent decades and billions of dollars learning hard lessons about safety through patient safety incidents and regulatory enforcement.</p> <p>The Joint Commission found that 80% of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during patient handoffs. The root causes are: - No explicit verification steps - Assumptions about what the receiving party knows - Time pressure leading to shortcuts - Information loss during transitions</p> <p>Healthcare's solution: standardized checklists with read-back verification. Failure rates dropped from 23% to under 5%.</p> <p>I realized software makes the exact same mistakes during deployments. So I built an AI framework that learns these patterns from healthcare code and applies them to predict deployment failures.</p> <p>Here's what makes this unique:</p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf No other AI framework does cross-domain pattern transfer Traditional code analysis tools work in isolation. They can't recognize that hospital shift-change protocols have relevance to Kubernetes deployments.</p> <p>\ud83e\udde0 Level 5 Systems Empathy Five levels of understanding: 1. Syntactic - Parse code structure 2. Semantic - Understand execution flow 3. Pragmatic - Know developer intent 4. Anticipatory - Predict future failures 5. Transformative - Learn across domains \u2190 This is new</p> <p>\ud83d\udcbe Long-term memory with MemDocs Patterns are stored across sessions and retrieved via semantic matching, enabling the AI to learn from previous analyses.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcca Real predictions Not just \"this code might have issues.\" It says \"based on the healthcare handoff pattern, your deployment will likely fail in 30-45 days with 87% confidence, here's why, here's how to prevent it.\"</p> <p>Try it now: <pre><code>pip install empathy-framework[full]\npython examples/level_5_transformative/run_full_demo.py\n</code></pre></p> <p>Fair Source 0.9 licensed: - \u2705 Free forever for students, educators, and small teams (\u22645 employees) - \u2705 $99/dev/year for commercial teams - \u2705 Full source code access - \u2705 Auto-converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029</p> <p>What's next? I'm exploring patterns from: - Aviation (pre-flight checklists \u2192 pre-deployment verification) - Finance (audit trails \u2192 code change compliance) - Manufacturing (quality gates \u2192 CI/CD gates)</p> <p>Questions I'd love feedback on: 1. What other cross-domain patterns would be valuable for your team? 2. How should this integrate with existing tools? (CI/CD pipelines, IDE extensions, pre-commit hooks?) 3.

A: Great question! Static analysis tools work within a single domain\u2014they analyze your code in isolation. The Empathy Framework's Level 5 capability learns patterns from completely different domains (like healthcare) and applies them to software. It's not just finding bugs in your code; it's recognizing that hospital shift-change protocols have relevance to deployment handoffs. That cross-domain reasoning is what makes this unique.</p> <p>Q: What's the accuracy of these predictions? A: In the Level 5 demo, we show 87% confidence for deployment handoff failures based on the healthcare pattern match. The confidence score is calculated from: (1) semantic similarity between domains, (2) source domain research quality (healthcare handoff research is very well documented), and (3) number of matching vulnerability indicators. We're actively collecting real-world validation data to refine these scores.</p> <p>Q: Does this work with my tech stack? A: The framework is language-agnostic at the pattern level. The Coach Wizards currently have best support for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Java, but the cross-domain pattern matching works on any code since it's analyzing structural patterns rather than syntax. If you have specific language needs, we're happy to add support!</p> <p>Q: Why Fair Source instead of fully open source? A: Fair Source balances free access for small teams with sustainable development. It's free forever for students, educators, and teams \u22645 employees. Commercial teams pay $99/dev/year, which funds ongoing development and support. Plus it auto-converts to Apache 2.0 on January 1, 2029, so it will be fully open source in 4 years.</p> <p>Q: How do I contribute patterns from my industry? A: We'd love that! The pattern contribution process is: (1) Identify a well-documented failure mode in your industry with research backing, (2) Create a pattern definition with indicators and solutions, (3) Submit via PR with validation test cases. Check out the contributing guidelines in the repo for details. Currently prioritizing aviation, finance, and manufacturing patterns.</p> <p>Q: Can this integrate with my CI/CD pipeline? A: Yes! You can run the framework in your CI/CD pipeline via command line or API. We're building official integrations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. The analysis can run as a pre-deployment check and block deployments if high-confidence failure predictions are found.</p>"},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT.html#success-metrics","title":"Success Metrics","text":"<p>Targets for Launch Day: - 200+ upvotes - Top 5 product of the day - 50+ comments - 100+ GitHub stars - 500+ demo runs</p> <p>Follow-up Metrics (First Week): - 500+ upvotes - Featured in Product Hunt newsletter - 500+ GitHub stars - 10+ community pattern contributions - 5+ commercial license inquiries</p>"},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT.html#post-launch-communication","title":"Post-Launch Communication","text":""},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT.html#thank-you-post-end-of-launch-day","title":"Thank You Post (End of Launch Day)","text":"<p>Title: Thank you Product Hunt! \ud83c\udf89</p> <p>Content:</p> <p>Wow!

The Joint Commission found that 80% of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during patient handoffs. Healthcare's solution: standardized checklists with verification steps.
