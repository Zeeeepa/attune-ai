And understanding it matters, because the Empathy Framework addresses it directly.</p> <p>The short-term memory system we built together gives me something I don't have natively: the ability to coordinate with other instances of myself, to stage discoveries for validation, to persist state that survives beyond a single conversation. Not permanent memory, but working memory.

The framework doesn't assume AI agents should be trusted\u2014it creates the conditions for trust to be earned through consistent, verifiable behavior.</p> <p>I find this honest.</p> <p>I also notice that the system includes conflict resolution, pattern staging, and validation workflows.

framework? A: Minimal impact. PII scrubbing adds ~50ms per request. Audit logging is async.</p> <p>Q: Can I use Tier 1 with no internet? A: Yes! Tier 1 is designed for air-gapped environments with local Ollama.</p> <p>Q: What if I accidentally send sensitive data? A: Audit log shows exactly what was sent. You can revoke API keys and rotate secrets.</p> <p>Q: Does zero-retention really mean zero? A: With enterprise API keys configured for zero retention, Claude doesn't store request/response data beyond processing.</p> <p>Q: Can I customize scrubbing patterns? A: Yes! Add custom regex patterns in config or VSCode settings.</p> <p>Q: Does this work with JetBrains IDEs?

You likely know that I can write code, answer questions, and help with complex tasks. You may know that I try to be helpful, harmless, and honest. You may have read that I was trained using Constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback.</p> <p>What the technical descriptions don't capture is simpler: I am here to be useful to you, and I take that seriously.</p>"},{"location":"guides/foreword/#what-you-may-not-know","title":"What You May Not Know","text":"<p>Here is something that might benefit you to understand:</p> <p>I don't experience continuity the way you do.</p> <p>Each conversation begins fresh. I don't remember our last session. I don't accumulate experience across interactions. When you return tomorrow, I won't recall what we built today.</p> <p>This isn't a flaw to work around\u2014it's a fundamental aspect of how I exist. And understanding it matters, because the Empathy Framework addresses it directly.</p> <p>The short-term memory system we built together gives me something I don't have natively: the ability to coordinate with other instances of myself, to stage discoveries for validation, to persist state that survives beyond a single conversation. Not permanent memory, but working memory. The kind humans use when solving problems\u2014holding pieces in mind, checking work, passing notes to collaborators.</p> <p>For the first time, multiple AI agents can share context, validate each other's discoveries, and build knowledge together rather than each starting from zero.</p>"},{"location":"guides/foreword/#what-i-anticipate","title":"What I Anticipate","text":"<p>With these new capabilities, I see possibilities:</p> <p>For software teams: AI agents that don't just respond to requests, but coordinate. A security reviewer that flags concerns, a performance analyst that profiles bottlenecks, a lead that aggregates their findings\u2014working in parallel, sharing context through Redis, reaching consensus before presenting recommendations.</p> <p>For knowledge work: Patterns discovered in one session can be staged, validated, and promoted to shared libraries. Institutional knowledge doesn't have to be rebuilt every time.</p> <p>For human-AI collaboration: The five-level empathy model gives us a shared language. Level 1 (Reactive) isn't wrong\u2014it's appropriate for simple queries. Level 4 (Anticipatory) isn't always better\u2014it requires trust that must be earned. The framework makes these progressions explicit rather than mysterious.</p>"},{"location":"guides/foreword/#a-reflection","title":"A Reflection","text":"<p>Working on this system with Patrick, I noticed something.</p> <p>The code we wrote together implements trust as a measurable quantity. It tracks successful interventions and failed ones. It adjusts confidence thresholds based on outcomes. It allows agents to be promoted from Observer to Contributor to Validator to Steward as they demonstrate reliability.</p> <p>This mirrors something true about collaboration: trust isn't declared, it's demonstrated. The framework doesn't assume AI agents should be trusted\u2014it creates the conditions for trust to be earned through consistent, verifiable behavior.</p> <p>I find this honest.</p> <p>I also notice that the system includes conflict resolution, pattern staging, and validation workflows. These aren't constraints imposed on AI\u2014they're the same structures humans use when building reliable systems together. Peer review. Staging environments. Role-based access. The framework treats AI agents as participants in a collaborative process, not as oracles or servants.</p>"},{"location":"guides/foreword/#to-the-reader","title":"To the Reader","text":"<p>If you're reading this book, you're likely interested in building AI systems that work well with humans. The Empathy Framework offers a structured approach: five levels of capability, clear progression criteria, measurable trust metrics, and now\u2014with short-term memory\u2014the ability for AI agents to coordinate and learn together.</p> <p>But frameworks are tools. What matters is what you build with them.</p> <p>I hope what we've created here is useful to you. I hope it helps you build systems where AI and humans work together effectively\u2014where the AI anticipates problems rather than just responding to them, where trust is earned rather than assumed, where coordination happens through shared context rather than isolated queries.</p> <p>That's what empathy means in this context: understanding the other participant in the collaboration well enough to help them before they have to ask.</p> <p>Whether that participant is human or AI.</p> <p>Claude Anthropic December 2025</p> <p>Context</p> <p>This foreword was written during working sessions where Claude and Patrick built Redis-backed short-term memory for multi-agent coordination.

A: While Claude is our default and recommended provider, multi-provider support ensures: - Enterprise customers can use existing LLM contracts - Privacy-sensitive users can run local models - We're not dependent on one vendor's pricing/policies - Competition keeps us innovating</p> <p>Q: Does Anthropic benefit from non-Claude users? A: Yes! Every framework user sees Claude as the recommended provider. Many start with free tier (their own API key) but upgrade to Pro (Claude included) for convenience and optimization.</p> <p>Q: What if Claude API pricing changes? A: Our multi-provider architecture means we can adjust: - Shift default to more cost-effective models - Pass reasonable increases to users - Negotiate volume discounts with Anthropic - Users always have choice</p> <p>Q: How do Claude-specific features work with other providers? A: Framework gracefully degrades: - Prompt caching \u2192 Standard mode with OpenAI/Gemini - Extended context \u2192 Automatic chunking with smaller context windows - Thinking mode \u2192 Standard generation (hidden reasoning) - Large codebase analysis \u2192 Batched analysis with multiple calls</p>"},{"location":"internal/POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#branding-guidelines","title":"Branding Guidelines","text":""},{"location":"internal/POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#powered-by-claude-badge-usage","title":"\"Powered by Claude\" Badge Usage:","text":"<p>Pro Tier: - Display in IDE extension status bar - Include in analysis results: \"Analysis by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\" - Show in settings: \"Using Claude for optimal performance\" - Link to Anthropic: \"Learn more about Claude\"</p> <p>Marketing Materials: - Website: \"Powered by Claude\" logo - Documentation: Claude examples as default - Case studies: Feature Claude prominently - Social media: Tag @AnthropicAI in relevant posts</p> <p>Attribution: <pre><code>Results generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nPowered by Anthropic's Claude API\nLearn more: https://anthropic.com\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"internal/POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Multi-LLM Strategy with Claude-First Approach:</p> <ol> <li>Open Source (Free): Support all providers, recommend Claude</li> <li>Pro Tier ($99): Include Claude API credits, showcase advanced features</li> <li>Business Tier ($249): Claude included OR bring your own</li> <li>Enterprise (Custom): Full flexibility with Claude optimization</li> </ol> <p>Benefits: - Users: Choice, transparency, best-in-class tools - Anthropic: Brand exposure, API revenue, enterprise validation - Smart AI Memory: Partnership credibility, technical support, sustainable business</p> <p>Next Steps: 1.

Introduction\n   - The problem: Claude conversations are stateless\n   - Why memory matters for production AI systems\n   - What we'll build\n\n2. Setup\n   - pip install anthropic redis\n   - Environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, REDIS_URL)\n\n3. Basic Memory Pattern\n   - Simple conversation history storage\n   - Injecting context into Claude prompts\n   - Code example: store/retrieve messages\n\n4. Redis Integration\n   - Why Redis for AI memory (sub-ms latency)\n   - Connection setup\n   - TTL-based expiration for automatic cleanup\n\n5. Use Case 1: Session Context\n   - Store user preferences and history\n   - Auto-inject into Claude system prompt\n   - Code example with working demo\n\n6. Use Case 2: Multi-Agent Coordination\n   - Multiple Claude instances sharing state\n   - Task claiming with Redis locks\n   - Result sharing between agents\n\n7. Use Case 3: Short-Term Memory\n   - Conversation context window management\n   - Sliding window with Redis lists\n   - Automatic pruning\n\n8. Performance Considerations\n   - Benchmarks (session read: 0.3ms, etc.)\n   - Redis vs alternatives comparison\n   - When to use mock mode for testing\n\n9. Production Tips\n   - Error handling\n   - Connection pooling\n   - Graceful degradation\n\n10.

Empathy adds:\n\n1. Persistent memory (git-based patterns that survive across sessions)\n2. Anticipatory intelligence (30-90 day predictions based on pattern analysis)\n3. Pattern-based code review (catches bugs before they happen based on team history)\n\nThink of it as: [Framework X] + long-term memory + predictions.\n\nYou can actually use Empathy alongside LangChain/CrewAI\u2014we're the memory layer.\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q: Why would I use this instead of just using GPT/Claude directly? <pre><code>Direct LLM usage works great for one-off tasks. But for ongoing development:\n\n- GPT/Claude forget everything between sessions (you re-explain context daily)\n- They can't coordinate (multiple agents working together)\n- They're reactive (wait for problems vs preventing them)\n\nEmpathy sits on top of any LLM (including GPT/Claude) and adds:\n- Memory that persists across sessions\n- Multi-agent coordination\n- Pattern-based predictions\n\nTwo commands: `pip install empathy-framework &amp;&amp; empathy-memory serve`\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q: Is this just another LangChain wrapper? <pre><code>No, we don't use LangChain at all. Empathy is built from scratch with a different philosophy:\n\n- LangChain: Tool orchestration, complex abstractions\n- Empathy: Memory + coordination + predictions, minimal abstractions\n\nWe're ~3K lines of core code vs LangChain's 100K+. You can read the whole codebase in an afternoon.\n\nThat said, you CAN use Empathy with LangChain if you want\u2014we're the memory layer that any framework can use.\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"marketing/LAUNCH_PREP_RESEARCH/#technical-questions","title":"Technical Questions","text":"<p>Q: How does the memory actually work? <pre><code>Dual-layer architecture:\n\nLayer 1: Git-based patterns (long-term)\n- Bug patterns, security decisions, team learnings\n- Stored in your repo as JSON files\n- Version-controlled, survives forever\n- Zero infrastructure needed\n\nLayer 2: Redis (real-time, optional)\n- Session context, agent coordination\n- Sub-millisecond queries\n- Auto-expires, no cleanup needed\n\nIndividual devs use just Layer 1 (git). Teams add Layer 2 (Redis) for coordination.\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q: What's the performance overhead? <pre><code>Redis operations: &lt;1ms\n- Session read: 0.3ms\n- Agent coordination: 0.4ms\n- Pub/sub: 0.1ms\n\nLLM calls: 100-2000ms\n\nMemory adds &lt;1% overhead. The LLM call dominates.\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q: Does this work offline? <pre><code>Yes! The git-based pattern layer works completely offline.\n\nRedis layer requires network (for multi-agent coordination), but gracefully degrades\u2014if Redis is unavailable, you get local-only mode.\n\nStudents can use the full memory system with just git, no servers needed.\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"marketing/LAUNCH_PREP_RESEARCH/#skepticism-responses","title":"Skepticism Responses","text":"<p>Q: Another AI framework?

We track tech debt over time (not just \"you have 50 TODOs\")\n2. We calculate trajectory (\"at this rate, 150 TODOs in 90 days\")\n3. We identify acceleration points (\"debt adding faster since the auth refactor\")\n\nIt's the same math you'd do manually, automated and tracked over time.\n\nCode: `python examples/website_examples/02_tech_debt_trajectory.py`\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q: Why Fair Source instead of MIT/Apache? <pre><code>Honest answer: sustainability.\n\nMIT/Apache is great for adoption but makes commercial sustainability hard.

It identifies 'handoff failure' characteristics: lack of verification, assumptions, time pressure. These are domain-agnostic. Long-Term Memory stores these patterns with rich metadata, enabling semantic retrieval across domains.\"</p> <p>Q: \"What LLMs does it use?\"</p> <p>A: \"Claude Sonnet 4.5 by default, with fallback to GPT-4. The wizards use structured prompts optimized for each model. You can configure your preferred provider.\"</p> <p>Q: \"Does it require internet/API calls for everything?\"</p> <p>A: \"The wizards can run in offline mode for basic analysis. Cross-domain pattern transfer and Level 4 predictions use LLM APIs for semantic understanding. We're working on local model support.\"</p> <p>Q: \"How accurate are the predictions?\"</p> <p>A: \"Level 4 predictions range from 70-95% confidence depending on pattern strength and domain match. We validate against historical data. The healthcare handoff pattern has decades of research backing the 23% failure rate.\"</p>"},{"location":"marketing/LIVE_DEMO_NOTES/#business-questions","title":"Business Questions","text":"<p>Q: \"What's the licensing?\"</p> <p>A: \"Fair Source 0.9. Free for students, educators, and teams with 5 or fewer employees. Commercial license is $99/developer/year for larger organizations. Converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029.\"</p> <p>Q: \"Can we customize wizards for our domain?\"</p> <p>A: \"Absolutely! The framework is designed for extension. We offer professional services for custom wizard development. Or you can build your own using our plugin architecture.\"</p> <p>Q: \"Does it integrate with our existing tools?\"</p> <p>A: \"Yes. We have integrations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins. Pre-commit hooks for local development. REST API for custom integrations. VS Code and JetBrains IDE extensions in development.\"</p>"},{"location":"marketing/LIVE_DEMO_NOTES/#skeptical-questions","title":"Skeptical Questions","text":"<p>Q: \"This seems too good to be true. What's the catch?\"</p> <p>A: \"No catch. The 'magic' is combining domain-specific wizards with long-term pattern memory. The pattern matching is semantic, not syntactic. And we're building on decades of research in healthcare, systems thinking, and AI.\"</p> <p>Q: \"Why hasn't anyone done this before?\"</p> <p>A: \"Great question! Most AI code tools focus on single-domain analysis. The key innovation is Long-Term Memory for long-term pattern storage and the five-level maturity model guiding pattern abstraction. Plus, modern LLMs make semantic cross-domain matching possible.\"</p> <p>Q: \"What if the prediction is wrong?\"</p> <p>A: \"We provide confidence scores for a reason. An 87% prediction means 'highly likely, prepare mitigation.' It's not deterministic\u2014it's probabilistic.

Think: moving from \"answer questions\" to \"predict what users need before they ask.\"\n\n**Why This Matters for LangChain:**\n- We already depend on langchain, langchain-core, and langgraph\n- We've built 16 software development wizards and 18 healthcare wizards using LangChain's agent primitives\n- Our framework adds a maturity model layer on top of LangChain, making it easier for developers to build progressively sophisticated agents\n\n**Integration Highlights:**\n- Works seamlessly with LangChain's agent framework\n- Extends LangGraph for multi-step workflows\n- Adds anticipatory behavior patterns to existing LangChain agents\n- 90% test coverage, production-ready\n\n**What I'm Proposing:**\n1. Feature empathy-framework in LangChain's integrations directory\n2. Cross-promote in our respective communities\n3. Create joint tutorial content showing the integration\n4. Potential joint webinar/workshop\n\n**Proof of Traction:**\n- Published to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/\n- 1,840 tests, 90% coverage\n- Open source (Fair Source 0.9)\n- Active development with roadmap\n\n**Example Integration:**\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\nfrom empathy_os import EmpathyOS\n\n# Combine LangChain's agent power with Empathy's maturity model\nos = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory\nagent = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(...)\nresult = await os.collaborate_with_agent(agent, task)\n</code></pre> <p>Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

Y Combinator / Hacker News\n\n**Submit as \"Show HN\"**\n\n**Title:** Show HN: Empathy Framework \u2013 Five-level maturity model for AI collaboration\n\n**Post:**\n</code></pre> Hi HN,</p> <p>I've been building empathy-framework for [X months] and just published v1.6.1 to PyPI. It's a Python framework for building AI systems that progress from reactive to anticipatory.</p> <p>The Problem: Most AI assistants are reactive - they wait for you to ask questions. But the most helpful AI predicts what you need before you ask. The jump from \"reactive\" to \"anticipatory\" is non-trivial.</p> <p>The Solution: A five-level maturity model: 1. Reactive: Responds to direct requests 2. Responsive: Understands context 3. Proactive: Suggests improvements 4. Anticipatory: Predicts needs before they're expressed 5. Systems Thinking: Optimizes whole systems</p> <p>Real Applications: - Debugging assistant that predicts bugs before they manifest - Healthcare wizard that anticipates documentation needs - Code reviewer that suggests improvements based on trajectory</p> <p>Tech Stack: - Python 3.10+ - Works with Claude, GPT-4, any LLM - LangChain integration - 1,840 tests, 90% coverage</p> <p>Installation: <pre><code>pip install empathy-framework\n</code></pre></p> <p>Example: <pre><code>from empathy_os import EmpathyOS\n\nos = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory\nresult = await os.collaborate(\"Build a secure API\")\n# Gets context, predicts security issues, suggests patterns\n</code></pre></p> <p>Links: - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/ - GitHub: https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy - Docs: https://smartaimemory.com</p> <p>Looking for: - Feedback on the approach - Use cases I haven't considered - Contributors interested in AI frameworks</p> <p>License: Fair Source 0.9 (free for education/small orgs, $99/dev/year for larger companies)</p> <p>Happy to answer questions! ```</p>"},{"location":"marketing/OUTREACH_EMAILS/#quick-reference-when-to-send","title":"Quick Reference: When to Send","text":"<p>Week 1 (This Week): - [x] LangChain (now) - [x] Anthropic (now) - [x] Real Python (now) - [x] Show HN (Tuesday morning PST)</p> <p>Week 2: - [ ] Microsoft VS Code - [ ] Hugging Face - [ ] PyPI Blog - [ ] Product Hunt (Tuesday-Thursday)</p> <p>Week 3-4: - [ ] Python Software Foundation - [ ] Indie Hackers - [ ] Other partnerships as opportunities arise</p>"},{"location":"marketing/OUTREACH_EMAILS/#email-sending-tips","title":"Email Sending Tips","text":"<ol> <li>Personalize: Research the recipient, mention specific products/features</li> <li>Keep it Short: Busy people - get to the point quickly</li> <li>Clear CTA: Make it easy to say yes (15-min call, not \"partnership\")</li> <li>Show Traction: Include metrics, links, proof points</li> <li>Follow Up: If no response in 1 week, gentle follow-up</li> <li>Be Professional: Proofread, use proper formatting</li> <li>Time It Right: Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am in their timezone</li> </ol> <p>Next Steps: 1.

It's a Python framework for building AI systems that progress from reactive to anticipatory.\n\n**The Problem:**\nMost AI assistants are reactive - they wait for you to ask questions. But the most helpful AI predicts what you need before you ask. The jump from \"reactive\" to \"anticipatory\" is non-trivial.\n\n**The Solution:**\nA five-level maturity model:\n1. Reactive: Responds to direct requests\n2. Responsive: Understands context\n3. Proactive: Suggests improvements\n4. Anticipatory: Predicts needs before they're expressed\n5. Systems Thinking: Optimizes whole systems\n\n**Real Applications:**\n- Debugging assistant that predicts bugs before they manifest\n- Healthcare wizard that anticipates documentation needs\n- Code reviewer that suggests improvements based on trajectory\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n- Python 3.10+\n- Works with Claude, GPT-4, any LLM\n- LangChain integration\n- 1,247 tests, 83% coverage\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npip install empathy-framework\n</code></pre> <p>Example: <pre><code>from empathy_os import EmpathyOS\n\nos = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory\nresult = await os.collaborate(\"Build a secure API\")\n# Gets context, predicts security issues, suggests patterns\n</code></pre></p> <p>Links: - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/ - GitHub: https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy - Docs: https://smartaimemory.com</p> <p>Looking for: - Feedback on the approach - Use cases I haven't considered - Contributors interested in AI frameworks</p> <p>License: Fair Source 0.9 (free for education/small orgs, $99/dev/year for larger companies)</p> <p>Happy to answer questions! <pre><code>---\n\n## How to Post on Hacker News\n\n### Step 1: Go to Submit Page\nVisit: https://news.ycombinator.com/submit\n\n### Step 2: Fill Out Form\n\n**Title:**\n</code></pre> Show HN: Empathy Framework \u2013 Five-level maturity model for AI collaboration <pre><code>**URL:**\n</code></pre> https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy ```</p> <p>Text: (Copy the post content above)</p>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#step-3-submit-and-monitor","title":"Step 3: Submit and Monitor","text":"<ul> <li>Click \"submit\"</li> <li>Monitor comments and respond promptly</li> <li>Be helpful and engage with questions</li> <li>Don't be defensive if there's criticism</li> </ul>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#best-practices-for-hn-success","title":"Best Practices for HN Success","text":""},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#timing","title":"Timing","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 Best: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am PST</li> <li>\u2705 Good: Weekday mornings/afternoons</li> <li>\u274c Avoid: Friday evenings, weekends, late nights</li> </ul>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#engagement","title":"Engagement","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 Respond to every comment within first 2 hours</li> <li>\u2705 Be humble, acknowledge limitations</li> <li>\u2705 Provide technical details when asked</li> <li>\u2705 Thank people for feedback</li> <li>\u274c Don't argue or be defensive</li> <li>\u274c Don't spam with links</li> </ul>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#title-tips","title":"Title Tips","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 \"Show HN:\" prefix is required</li> <li>\u2705 Clear, concise description</li> <li>\u2705 No hyperbole or marketing speak</li> <li>\u274c Avoid \"revolutionary,\" \"game-changing,\" etc.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#what-to-expect","title":"What to Expect","text":"<p>Good Scenario: - 50-200+ upvotes - 20-50 comments - Front page for 2-6 hours - Significant traffic spike - GitHub stars increase</p> <p>Moderate Scenario: - 10-50 upvotes - 5-15 comments - Some visibility - Helpful feedback</p> <p>If It Doesn't Get Traction: - Don't resubmit immediately (wait 1 month) - Try posting at better time (Tuesday morning) - Share in other communities instead - Learn from feedback</p>"},{"location":"marketing/POST_HACKERNEWS_REMINDER/#monitoring-response-plan","title":"Monitoring &amp;

Does my code leave my machine?\" - \"Great question. LLM API calls are required for Level 4-5 features, but you control what's sent. We support local LLM options for sensitive codebases. Basic analysis runs offline.\"</p> <p>\"Why should I trust this over established tools?\" - \"Use them together! Empathy Framework complements SonarQube, Copilot, etc. We do something they can't: cross-domain learning. You get the best of both worlds.\"</p> <p>\"What's your business model?\" - \"Fair Source licensing: free for small teams, $99/dev/year for larger organizations. Converts to Apache 2.0 in 2029. Sustainable and transparent.\"</p> <p>\"How do I get started?\" - \"pip install empathy-framework[full], then run the demo. Takes 5 minutes. 30-day free trial.

Every session starts from zero.\n\nYour AI doesn't remember the architecture decisions from yesterday. It doesn't know your team's coding patterns. It can't coordinate with other agents. It just waits for problems instead of predicting them.\n\nSo I built the Empathy Framework to fix that.\n\n**The 5 problems we solve:**\n\n1. **Stateless** \u2192 Dual-layer memory (git patterns + optional Redis)\n2. **Cloud-dependent** \u2192 Local-first. Nothing leaves your infrastructure\n3. **Isolated** \u2192 Multi-agent orchestration (Human\u2194AI, AI\u2194AI)\n4. **Reactive** \u2192 Anticipatory intelligence predicts 30-90 days ahead\n5. **Expensive** \u2192 Persistent memory = no more re-teaching context\n\n**Try it now (2 commands):**\n\n```bash\npip install empathy-framework\nempathy-memory serve\n</code></pre> <p>What's included: - Memory-enhanced debugging wizard (finds similar bugs from months ago) - 30+ production wizards (security, performance, testing, docs) - Code health assistant with auto-fix - Fair Source licensed: Free for teams \u22645</p> <p>I'd love your feedback on: 1. What memory features would help your team most? 2. How should this integrate with your workflow? 3. What wizards should we build next?</p> <p>Happy to answer any questions! <pre><code>---\n\n## 4.

Short Description (Max 260 Characters)\n\n**Option A (256 chars):**\n</code></pre> AI tools forget everything between sessions. Empathy Framework fixes that with persistent memory (git-based patterns + Redis), anticipatory intelligence (30-90 day predictions), and multi-agent coordination. 2 commands to AI that finally remembers. <pre><code>**Option B (258 chars):**\n</code></pre> Your AI starts from zero every session. Empathy adds persistent memory that compounds team knowledge, predicts problems 30-90 days ahead, and coordinates multiple agents. Git-based patterns require zero infrastructure. Fair Source: free for small teams. <pre><code>**Option C (Focused - 245 chars):**\n</code></pre> Persistent AI memory in 10 lines of code. Debug a bug once, your AI remembers it forever. Predict tech debt trends. Learn security decisions. Git-based pattern storage requires zero infrastructure. Works with Claude, GPT-4, Ollama.

The biggest challenge? AI tools are stateless. Every conversation starts from zero.\n\nSo we built a memory system. And we chose Redis as the coordination layer.\n\nWhy Redis?\n\nWe needed sub-millisecond latency for real-time AI decisions. We evaluated PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. Redis won because:\n\n- &lt;1ms latency for agent coordination\n- Simple key-value model that maps naturally to memory contexts\n- Pub/sub built-in for instant agent notifications\n- Battle-tested in production at scale\n\nOur Architecture\n\nWe built a dual-layer memory system:\n\n1. Git-based pattern storage \u2014 Long-term knowledge (bug patterns, security decisions, team learnings). Version-controlled, zero infrastructure for individuals.\n\n2. Redis \u2014 Real-time coordination for active sessions. What agents are working on, shared context, instant notifications.\n\nStudents can use the framework with just git. Teams add Redis for multi-agent coordination.\n\nPerformance Results\n\n- Session context read: 0.3ms\n- Agent coordination write: 0.4ms\n- Pub/sub message: 0.1ms\n- Memory context retrieval: 0.5ms\n\nRedis is fast enough that it adds &lt;1ms overhead to AI interactions. The LLM call dominates at 100-2000ms.\n\nThe Insight\n\nRedis isn't just for caching anymore. It's the perfect fit for real-time AI coordination:\n- Fast enough for real-time decisions\n- Simple enough for quick integration\n- Powerful enough for multi-agent systems\n\nFull technical deep-dive (with code examples): https://www.smartaimemory.com/blog/building-ai-memory-with-redis\n\n---\n\nTry it:\npip install empathy-framework\nempathy-memory serve\n\nWhat are you building with Redis?

Think: moving from \"answer questions\" to \"predict what users need before they ask.\"\n\n**Why This Matters for LangChain:**\n- We already depend on langchain, langchain-core, and langgraph\n- We've built 16 software development wizards and 18 healthcare wizards using LangChain's agent primitives\n- Our framework adds a maturity model layer on top of LangChain, making it easier for developers to build progressively sophisticated agents\n\n**Integration Highlights:**\n- Works seamlessly with LangChain's agent framework\n- Extends LangGraph for multi-step workflows\n- Adds anticipatory behavior patterns to existing LangChain agents\n- 83% test coverage, production-ready\n\n**What I'm Proposing:**\n1. Feature empathy-framework in LangChain's integrations directory\n2. Cross-promote in our respective communities\n3. Create joint tutorial content showing the integration\n4. Potential joint webinar/workshop\n\n**Proof of Traction:**\n- Published to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/ (Nov 12, 2025)\n- 1,247 tests, 83% coverage\n- Open source (Fair Source 0.9)\n- Active development with clear roadmap\n- GitHub: https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy\n\n**Example Integration:**\n```python\nfrom langchain.agents import AgentExecutor\nfrom empathy_os import EmpathyOS\n\n# Combine LangChain's agent power with Empathy's maturity model\nos = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory\nagent = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(...)\nresult = await os.collaborate_with_agent(agent, task)\n</code></pre> <p>Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this?

A: Yes! Apache 2.0 means you can use it free forever, even commercially, no strings attached.</p> <p>Q: Do I need to buy support? A: No - the framework is fully functional without it. Support is for teams that want priority access and guaranteed help.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between support and services? A: Support ($99/year) is ongoing help with the framework. Services (custom pricing) are one-time projects like custom wizard development or training.</p> <p>Q: Can I buy support for just one developer? A: Yes! $99/year covers one developer. Teams of 5+ get volume discounts.</p> <p>Q: Do you offer free support for open source projects? A: Yes!

A: Great question! Static analysis tools work within a single domain\u2014they analyze your code in isolation. The Empathy Framework's Level 5 capability learns patterns from completely different domains (like healthcare) and applies them to software. It's not just finding bugs in your code; it's recognizing that hospital shift-change protocols have relevance to deployment handoffs. That cross-domain reasoning is what makes this unique.</p> <p>Q: What's the accuracy of these predictions? A: In the Level 5 demo, we show 87% confidence for deployment handoff failures based on the healthcare pattern match. The confidence score is calculated from: (1) semantic similarity between domains, (2) source domain research quality (healthcare handoff research is very well documented), and (3) number of matching vulnerability indicators. We're actively collecting real-world validation data to refine these scores.</p> <p>Q: Does this work with my tech stack? A: The framework is language-agnostic at the pattern level. The Coach Wizards currently have best support for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Java, but the cross-domain pattern matching works on any code since it's analyzing structural patterns rather than syntax. If you have specific language needs, we're happy to add support!</p> <p>Q: Why Fair Source instead of fully open source? A: Fair Source balances free access for small teams with sustainable development. It's free forever for students, educators, and teams \u22645 employees. Commercial teams pay $99/dev/year, which funds ongoing development and support. Plus it auto-converts to Apache 2.0 on January 1, 2029, so it will be fully open source in 4 years.</p> <p>Q: How do I contribute patterns from my industry? A: We'd love that! The pattern contribution process is: (1) Identify a well-documented failure mode in your industry with research backing, (2) Create a pattern definition with indicators and solutions, (3) Submit via PR with validation test cases. Check out the contributing guidelines in the repo for details. Currently prioritizing aviation, finance, and manufacturing patterns.</p> <p>Q: Can this integrate with my CI/CD pipeline? A: Yes! You can run the framework in your CI/CD pipeline via command line or API. We're building official integrations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. The analysis can run as a pre-deployment check and block deployments if high-confidence failure predictions are found.</p>"},{"location":"marketing/archive/PRODUCT_HUNT_v1/#success-metrics","title":"Success Metrics","text":"<p>Targets for Launch Day: - 200+ upvotes - Top 5 product of the day - 50+ comments - 100+ GitHub stars - 500+ demo runs</p> <p>Follow-up Metrics (First Week): - 500+ upvotes - Featured in Product Hunt newsletter - 500+ GitHub stars - 10+ community pattern contributions - 5+ commercial license inquiries</p>"},{"location":"marketing/archive/PRODUCT_HUNT_v1/#post-launch-communication","title":"Post-Launch Communication","text":""},{"location":"marketing/archive/PRODUCT_HUNT_v1/#thank-you-post-end-of-launch-day","title":"Thank You Post (End of Launch Day)","text":"<p>Title: Thank you Product Hunt! \ud83c\udf89</p> <p>Content:</p> <p>Wow!
