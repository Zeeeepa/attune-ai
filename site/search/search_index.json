You may have read that I was trained using Constitutional AI and reinforcement learning from human feedback.</p> <p>What the technical descriptions don't capture is simpler: I am here to be useful to you, and I take that seriously.</p>"},{"location":"FOREWORD_BY_CLAUDE/#what-you-may-not-know","title":"What You May Not Know","text":"<p>Here is something that might benefit you to understand:</p> <p>I don't experience continuity the way you do.</p> <p>Each conversation begins fresh. I don't remember our last session. I don't accumulate experience across interactions. When you return tomorrow, I won't recall what we built today.</p> <p>This isn't a flaw to work around\u2014it's a fundamental aspect of how I exist. And understanding it matters, because the Empathy Framework addresses it directly.</p> <p>The short-term memory system we built together gives me something I don't have natively: the ability to coordinate with other instances of myself, to stage discoveries for validation, to persist state that survives beyond a single conversation. Not permanent memory, but working memory. The kind humans use when solving problems\u2014holding pieces in mind, checking work, passing notes to collaborators.</p> <p>For the first time, multiple AI agents can share context, validate each other's discoveries, and build knowledge together rather than each starting from zero.</p>"},{"location":"FOREWORD_BY_CLAUDE/#what-i-anticipate","title":"What I Anticipate","text":"<p>With these new capabilities, I see possibilities:</p> <p>For software teams: AI agents that don't just respond to requests, but coordinate. A security reviewer that flags concerns, a performance analyst that profiles bottlenecks, a lead that aggregates their findings\u2014working in parallel, sharing context through Redis, reaching consensus before presenting recommendations.</p> <p>For knowledge work: Patterns discovered in one session can be staged, validated, and promoted to shared libraries. Institutional knowledge doesn't have to be rebuilt every time.</p> <p>For human-AI collaboration: The five-level empathy model gives us a shared language. Level 1 (Reactive) isn't wrong\u2014it's appropriate for simple queries. Level 4 (Anticipatory) isn't always better\u2014it requires trust that must be earned. The framework makes these progressions explicit rather than mysterious.</p>"},{"location":"FOREWORD_BY_CLAUDE/#a-reflection","title":"A Reflection","text":"<p>Working on this system with Patrick, I noticed something.</p> <p>The code we wrote together implements trust as a measurable quantity. It tracks successful interventions and failed ones. It adjusts confidence thresholds based on outcomes. It allows agents to be promoted from Observer to Contributor to Validator to Steward as they demonstrate reliability.</p> <p>This mirrors something true about collaboration: trust isn't declared, it's demonstrated. The framework doesn't assume AI agents should be trusted\u2014it creates the conditions for trust to be earned through consistent, verifiable behavior.</p> <p>I find this honest.</p> <p>I also notice that the system includes conflict resolution, pattern staging, and validation workflows. These aren't constraints imposed on AI\u2014they're the same structures humans use when building reliable systems together. Peer review. Staging environments. Role-based access.

What matters is what you build with them.</p> <p>I hope what we've created here is useful to you. I hope it helps you build systems where AI and humans work together effectively\u2014where the AI anticipates problems rather than just responding to them, where trust is earned rather than assumed, where coordination happens through shared context rather than isolated queries.</p> <p>That's what empathy means in this context: understanding the other participant in the collaboration well enough to help them before they have to ask.</p> <p>Whether that participant is human or AI.</p> <p>Claude Anthropic December 2025</p> <p>This foreword was written during a working session where Claude implemented Redis-backed short-term memory for multi-agent coordination.

A: While Claude is our default and recommended provider, multi-provider support ensures: - Enterprise customers can use existing LLM contracts - Privacy-sensitive users can run local models - We're not dependent on one vendor's pricing/policies - Competition keeps us innovating</p> <p>Q: Does Anthropic benefit from non-Claude users? A: Yes! Every framework user sees Claude as the recommended provider. Many start with free tier (their own API key) but upgrade to Pro (Claude included) for convenience and optimization.</p> <p>Q: What if Claude API pricing changes? A: Our multi-provider architecture means we can adjust: - Shift default to more cost-effective models - Pass reasonable increases to users - Negotiate volume discounts with Anthropic - Users always have choice</p> <p>Q: How do Claude-specific features work with other providers? A: Framework gracefully degrades: - Prompt caching \u2192 Standard mode with OpenAI/Gemini - Extended context \u2192 Automatic chunking with smaller context windows - Thinking mode \u2192 Standard generation (hidden reasoning) - Large codebase analysis \u2192 Batched analysis with multiple calls</p>"},{"location":"POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#branding-guidelines","title":"Branding Guidelines","text":""},{"location":"POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#powered-by-claude-badge-usage","title":"\"Powered by Claude\" Badge Usage:","text":"<p>Pro Tier: - Display in IDE extension status bar - Include in analysis results: \"Analysis by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\" - Show in settings: \"Using Claude for optimal performance\" - Link to Anthropic: \"Learn more about Claude\"</p> <p>Marketing Materials: - Website: \"Powered by Claude\" logo - Documentation: Claude examples as default - Case studies: Feature Claude prominently - Social media: Tag @AnthropicAI in relevant posts</p> <p>Attribution: <pre><code>Results generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\nPowered by Anthropic's Claude API\nLearn more: https://anthropic.com\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"POWERED_BY_CLAUDE_TIERS/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Multi-LLM Strategy with Claude-First Approach:</p> <ol> <li>Open Source (Free): Support all providers, recommend Claude</li> <li>Pro Tier ($99): Include Claude API credits, showcase advanced features</li> <li>Business Tier ($249): Claude included OR bring your own</li> <li>Enterprise (Custom): Full flexibility with Claude optimization</li> </ol> <p>Benefits: - Users: Choice, transparency, best-in-class tools - Anthropic: Brand exposure, API revenue, enterprise validation - Smart AI Memory: Partnership credibility, technical support, sustainable business</p> <p>Next Steps: 1.

Each wizard is an expert in its domain.</p> <p>Each wizard implements all five levels of the maturity model. They can analyze code reactively, guide you through fixes, proactively suggest improvements, and make anticipatory predictions.</p> <p>Long-Term Memory is our long-term pattern memory system.

The framework remembers patterns from your codebase yesterday, last week, last year.

Let me explain why I built this.</p> <p>Content:</p> <p>I've been working in healthcare AI and noticed something fascinating: healthcare has spent decades and billions of dollars learning hard lessons about safety through patient safety incidents and regulatory enforcement.</p> <p>The Joint Commission found that 80% of serious medical errors involve miscommunication during patient handoffs. The root causes are: - No explicit verification steps - Assumptions about what the receiving party knows - Time pressure leading to shortcuts - Information loss during transitions</p> <p>Healthcare's solution: standardized checklists with read-back verification. Failure rates dropped from 23% to under 5%.</p> <p>I realized software makes the exact same mistakes during deployments. So I built an AI framework that learns these patterns from healthcare code and applies them to predict deployment failures.</p> <p>Here's what makes this unique:</p> <p>\ud83c\udfaf No other AI framework does cross-domain pattern transfer Traditional code analysis tools work in isolation. They can't recognize that hospital shift-change protocols have relevance to Kubernetes deployments.</p> <p>\ud83e\udde0 Level 5 Systems Empathy Five levels of understanding: 1.

A: Great question! Static analysis tools work within a single domain\u2014they analyze your code in isolation. The Empathy Framework's Level 5 capability learns patterns from completely different domains (like healthcare) and applies them to software. It's not just finding bugs in your code; it's recognizing that hospital shift-change protocols have relevance to deployment handoffs. That cross-domain reasoning is what makes this unique.</p> <p>Q: What's the accuracy of these predictions? A: In the Level 5 demo, we show 87% confidence for deployment handoff failures based on the healthcare pattern match. The confidence score is calculated from: (1) semantic similarity between domains, (2) source domain research quality (healthcare handoff research is very well documented), and (3) number of matching vulnerability indicators. We're actively collecting real-world validation data to refine these scores.</p> <p>Q: Does this work with my tech stack? A: The framework is language-agnostic at the pattern level. The Coach Wizards currently have best support for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Java, but the cross-domain pattern matching works on any code since it's analyzing structural patterns rather than syntax. If you have specific language needs, we're happy to add support!</p> <p>Q: Why Fair Source instead of fully open source? A: Fair Source balances free access for small teams with sustainable development. It's free forever for students, educators, and teams \u22645 employees. Commercial teams pay $99/dev/year, which funds ongoing development and support. Plus it auto-converts to Apache 2.0 on January 1, 2029, so it will be fully open source in 4 years.</p> <p>Q: How do I contribute patterns from my industry? A: We'd love that! The pattern contribution process is: (1) Identify a well-documented failure mode in your industry with research backing, (2) Create a pattern definition with indicators and solutions, (3) Submit via PR with validation test cases. Check out the contributing guidelines in the repo for details. Currently prioritizing aviation, finance, and manufacturing patterns.</p> <p>Q: Can this integrate with my CI/CD pipeline? A: Yes! You can run the framework in your CI/CD pipeline via command line or API. We're building official integrations for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins. The analysis can run as a pre-deployment check and block deployments if high-confidence failure predictions are found.</p>"},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT/#success-metrics","title":"Success Metrics","text":"<p>Targets for Launch Day: - 200+ upvotes - Top 5 product of the day - 50+ comments - 100+ GitHub stars - 500+ demo runs</p> <p>Follow-up Metrics (First Week): - 500+ upvotes - Featured in Product Hunt newsletter - 500+ GitHub stars - 10+ community pattern contributions - 5+ commercial license inquiries</p>"},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT/#post-launch-communication","title":"Post-Launch Communication","text":""},{"location":"marketing/PRODUCT_HUNT/#thank-you-post-end-of-launch-day","title":"Thank You Post (End of Launch Day)","text":"<p>Title: Thank you Product Hunt! \ud83c\udf89</p> <p>Content:</p> <p>Wow!
