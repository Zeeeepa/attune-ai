## Quick Start

```bash
python -m attune.models.auth_cli setup    # Configure authentication
python examples/dashboard_demo.py         # Agent dashboard at localhost:8000
```

## Command Hubs

Use `/hub-name` to access organized workflows:

| Hub | Key Routes | Description |
| --- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `/attune` | Socratic discovery | Natural language routing to all workflows |
| `/dev` | debug, review, commit, pr, refactor, quality | Developer tools |
| `/testing` | run, coverage, generate, tdd | Test runner and generation |
| `/workflows` | security, bugs, perf, review, list | Automated analysis |
| `/plan` | feature, tdd, refactor, architecture | Planning and strategy |
| `/docs` | generate, readme, changelog, explain | Documentation |
| `/release` | prep, security, health, publish | Release preparation |
| `/agent` | create, list, run, release-prep | Agent management |

## Critical Rules

- NEVER use eval() or exec()
- ALWAYS validate file paths with _validate_file_path()
- NEVER use bare except: - catch specific exceptions
- ALWAYS log exceptions before handling
- Type hints and docstrings required on all public APIs
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Security tests required for file operations
