# Compact State - Session Handoff

**Generated:** 2026-01-23
**Session Focus:** CLI & Slash Command Reorganization

## SBAR Handoff

### Situation
Completed major reorganization of both CLI commands and Claude Code slash commands to create a cleaner, hub-based navigation structure.

### Background
- **CLI Redesign:** Another Claude Code instance redesigned CLI with top-level workflow commands (`empathy code-review .`, `empathy security-audit .`, etc.) and subgroups (`report`, `memory`, `tier`, `utility`)
- **VS Code Extension:** Updated to use new CLI structure via WorkflowReportPanel (not terminal)
- **Slash Commands:** Reduced from 41 to 9 hub commands

### Assessment
**Completed work:**
1. VS Code extension updated - workflows run via WebviewPanel, not terminal
2. `cli_unified.py` refactored - extracted helpers, reduced function sizes under 20 lines
3. Created `quality-validator` agent (now accessible via `/dev` hub)
4. Updated deprecated CLI references (`empathy meta-workflow run` → `empathy <workflow> .`)
5. Consolidated slash commands to 9 hubs:
   - `/agent` - create-agent, create-team, list, invoke
   - `/context` - compact, restore, memory, status
   - `/dev` - debug, commit, pr, review-pr, quality-validator
   - `/docs` - explain, manage-docs, feature-overview
   - `/learning` - evaluate, patterns, learn
   - `/release` - release-prep, publish, security-scan
   - `/testing` - test, coverage, maintenance, benchmark
   - `/utilities` - init, deps, profile
   - `/workflow` - plan, tdd, review, refactor

**Files modified:**
- `src/empathy_os/cli_unified.py` - refactored helpers, constants
- `vscode-extension/src/panels/WorkflowReportPanel.ts` - new CLI commands
- `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` - uses WorkflowReportPanel
- `.claude/commands/*.md` - consolidated to 9 hubs

### Recommendation
- Test the hub navigation by running `/dev`, `/testing`, etc.
- Consider committing the changes if not already done
- User mentioned "the other way of navigating" - may want to explore CLI vs slash command symmetry

## Session Patterns

| Pattern | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Hub-based navigation | Both CLI and slash commands use hub structure |
| Quality-validator agent | Analyzes code for functions >20 lines, naming, etc. |
| Refactoring approach | Extract helpers, move constants to top of file |

## User Preferences

- Prefers WebviewPanel over terminal for workflow output
- Wants ~10 top-level items (clean navigation)
- Values consistency between CLI and slash command structure

## Trust Level
High - collaborative session with code modifications approved

## Pending
None explicitly stated. Ready for user's next direction.
