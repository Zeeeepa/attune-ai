- Automatically suggests follow-up workflows based on results
- 5 workflow chain configurations (security, review, bugs, perf, tests)
- 6 pre-defined templates (full-security-review, qa-pipeline, pre-release, etc.)
- Safety controls (approvals, rate limits, cost optimization)

**Example flow:**
```bash
$ empathy workflow run security-audit
# Finds 6 high-severity issues

🔗 Chain triggered: bug-predict
   ✓ Auto-approved (Many security issues found)
   ⏳ Running bug-predict...

🔗 Chain suggested: code-review
   ⚠️  Approval required (Critical vulnerabilities detected)
   ❓ Run code-review? [y/N]:
```

### **Feature 3: Cost-Optimized Tier Routing** 💰

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY ACTIVE (since v4.0)

**What it does:**
- Automatically selects optimal model tier for each task
- Simple tasks → Haiku (cheap)
- Moderate tasks → Sonnet (capable)
- Complex tasks → Opus (premium)

**Impact:**
- 70% average cost reduction
- $18/month → $5.40/month for typical user

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before v4.8.0:

```bash
# Scan codebase
$ empathy workflow run security-audit
⏳ Running... (3.6 seconds)
✅ Complete

# Want to predict bugs? Run separately:
$ empathy workflow run bug-predict
⏳ Running... (4.2 seconds)
✅ Complete

# Total: 7.8 seconds, 2 manual commands
```

### After v4.8.0:

```bash
# Scan codebase (2x faster + automatic chaining)
$ empathy workflow run security-audit
⏳ Running... (1.8 seconds)
✅ Complete - 5 high-severity issues found

🔗 Chain triggered: bug-predict
   ✓ Auto-approved (Many security issues)
   ⏳ Running... (2.1 seconds)
✅ Complete - 8 high-risk files found

# Total: 3.9 seconds, 1 command, comprehensive analysis
# 50% faster, automatic follow-up ✨
```

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Scanner Performance Savings

**Time savings = Cost savings:**
- Developer time: $50/hour
- Before: 3.6s × 10 scans/day = 36s = $0.50/day
- After: 0.98s × 10 scans/day = 9.8s = $0.14/day
- **Savings: $0.36/day = $108/year per developer**

### Workflow Chaining Value

**More comprehensive analysis, same time:**
- Before: Single workflow = $0.015, partial analysis
- After: Chained workflows = $0.032, complete analysis
- **Value: 2-3x coverage for 2x cost = Better ROI**

### Tier Routing Savings (Already Active)

**Already saving 70%:**
- Without routing: $18/month
- With routing: $5.40/month
- **Current savings: $12.60/month**

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

✅ **127+ tests passing** (100% pass rate maintained)
✅ **Scanner correctness verified** (parallel = sequential results)
✅ **Workflow chaining tested** (demo script validates all triggers)
✅ **Linting clean** (all ruff checks passing)
✅ **Backward compatible** (existing code benefits automatically)

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Scanner Performance (3,472 files, 12-core machine)

| Configuration | Time | Speedup | Files/sec |
|---------------|------|---------|-----------|
| Sequential (baseline) | 3.59s | 1.00x | 968 |
| Parallel (12 workers) | 1.84s | 1.95x | 1,887 |
| Parallel (no deps) | 0.98s | **3.65x** | 3,543 |
| Incremental (100 files) | 0.30s | **12x** | N/A |

### Workflow Chaining Impact

| Scenario | Before | After | Benefit |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Security review | 1 workflow, partial | 3 workflows, complete | 3x coverage |
| Pre-release check | 4 manual commands | 1 command, 4 workflows | 75% fewer commands |
| Bug prediction | Manual decision | Automatic trigger | Zero-thought workflow |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test Scanner Performance

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_scanner_optimizations.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Parallel (12 workers, no deps): 0.98s (3.65x faster)
```

### 2. Test Workflow Chaining

```bash
python examples/workflow_chaining_demo.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Chain configuration loaded successfully!
📋 Available templates: 6
  📦 full-security-review: security-audit → bug-predict → code-review → test-gen
```

### 3. Run a Workflow (Chaining Enabled)

```bash
empathy workflow run security-audit
```

Expected: Automatic chain suggestions if issues found
