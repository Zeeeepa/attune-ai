# attune

Single entry point for all attune-ai capabilities. Routes to the appropriate workflow based on context.

## Quick Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| `/attune security` | Run security audit |
| `/attune review` | Run code review |
| `/attune tests` | Generate tests |
| `/attune perf` | Run performance audit |
| `/attune release` | Run release preparation |
| `/attune memory` | Memory operations |
| `/attune empathy` | Get or set empathy level |
| `/attune setup` | Check environment and install prerequisites |
| `/attune update` | Check for attune-ai updates |

## Execution Instructions

When invoked with arguments, EXECUTE the corresponding action:

| Input | Action |
| ----- | ------ |
| `security` | Call `security_audit` MCP tool with current project path |
| `review` | Call `code_review` MCP tool with current project path |
| `tests` | Ask for module path, then call `test_generation` MCP tool |
| `perf` | Call `performance_audit` MCP tool with current project path |
| `release` | Call `release_prep` MCP tool with current project path |
| `bugs` | Call `bug_predict` MCP tool with current project path |
| `memory` | Route to memory-and-context skill |
| `store` | Ask for key and value, then call `memory_store` MCP tool |
| `retrieve` | Ask for key, then call `memory_retrieve` MCP tool |
| `search` | Ask for query, then call `memory_search` MCP tool |
| `forget` | Ask for key, then call `memory_forget` MCP tool |
| `empathy` | Call `empathy_get_level`, offer to change with `empathy_set_level` |
| `setup` | Trigger setup-guide agent |
| `update` | Check version via `version_check` module, offer upgrade if available |

## Natural Language Routing

| Pattern | Action |
| ------- | ------ |
| "security", "vulnerability", "audit", "scan" | security_audit |
| "review", "quality", "code review" | code_review |
| "test", "generate tests", "coverage" | test_generation |
| "performance", "bottleneck", "optimize" | performance_audit |
| "release", "publish", "ship", "deploy" | release_prep |
| "bug", "predict", "risk" | bug_predict |
| "memory", "store", "remember", "pattern" | memory-and-context skill |
| "forget", "remove", "delete memory" | memory_forget |
| "empathy", "level", "verbosity" | empathy_get_level / empathy_set_level |
| "setup", "install", "configure", "redis" | setup-guide agent |
| "version", "update", "upgrade" | version check |
| "cost", "spend", "usage", "telemetry" | telemetry_stats |
| "dashboard", "agents", "status" | dashboard_status |

## No-Argument Behavior

If no argument is provided, start with Socratic discovery:

"What are you trying to accomplish?"

Based on the answer, route to the appropriate skill or MCP tool. Do not present the full list of 18 tools. Ask clarifying questions to narrow down the intent.

## MCP Server Not Running

If the MCP server is not responding, trigger the setup-guide agent to diagnose and resolve the issue. Common causes:

- attune-ai not installed (`pip install attune-ai`)
- Python version below 3.10
- Server process not started

## Skills Reference

| Skill | Triggers |
| ----- | -------- |
| memory-and-context | memory, store, retrieve, empathy, pattern, classification |
| workflow-orchestration | workflow, run, execute, agent, team, release, security |
| refactor-plan | refactor, restructure, architecture, plan |
