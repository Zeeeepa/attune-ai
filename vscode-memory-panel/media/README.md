# Media Assets

This directory contains icons and images for the VS Code extension.

## Required Files

Create the following files for a complete extension:

### memory-icon.png
- 128x128px PNG
- Extension marketplace icon
- Should represent memory/database concept

### memory-sidebar.svg
- 24x24px SVG (provided)
- Activity bar icon
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- [Figma](https://figma.com) - Free design tool
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Free SVG editor
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) - Free image editor

## Design Guidelines

Follow VS Code icon guidelines:
- Use simple, clear shapes
- Ensure visibility in both light and dark themes
- Test at multiple sizes
- Avoid fine details that won't show at small sizes

## Temporary Placeholder

The extension will work without custom icons, falling back to VS Code defaults.
The provided SVG is a basic placeholder.
