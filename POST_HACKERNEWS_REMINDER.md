Show HN: Empathy Framework – Five-level maturity model for AI collaboration
```

### Post Content (Copy and Paste)

Hi HN,

I've just published empathy-framework to PyPI. It's a Python framework for building AI systems that progress from reactive to anticipatory.

**The Problem:**
Most AI assistants are reactive - they wait for you to ask questions. But the most helpful AI predicts what you need before you ask. The jump from "reactive" to "anticipatory" is non-trivial.

**The Solution:**
A five-level maturity model:
1. Reactive: Responds to direct requests
2. Responsive: Understands context
3. Proactive: Suggests improvements
4. Anticipatory: Predicts needs before they're expressed
5. Systems Thinking: Optimizes whole systems

**Real Applications:**
- Debugging assistant that predicts bugs before they manifest
- Healthcare wizard that anticipates documentation needs
- Code reviewer that suggests improvements based on trajectory

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.10+
- Works with Claude, GPT-4, any LLM
- LangChain integration
- 1,247 tests, 83% coverage

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install empathy-framework
```

**Example:**
```python
from empathy_os import EmpathyOS

os = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory
result = await os.collaborate("Build a secure API")
# Gets context, predicts security issues, suggests patterns
```

Happy to answer questions!
