        question: 'What is Attune AI?',
        answer: 'Attune AI is a production-ready framework for AI-powered developer workflows with cost optimization and multi-agent orchestration. It includes 13 agent templates, dynamic team composition, persistent agent state, 10+ integrated workflows, and a tier-based LLM routing system that saves 34-86% on API costs.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is multi-agent orchestration?',
        answer: 'Multi-agent orchestration lets you compose teams of specialized AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks. Attune AI supports parallel, sequential, two-phase, and delegation strategies with quality gates to ensure results meet your standards. The MetaOrchestrator analyzes tasks and automatically selects optimal agent teams.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Agent State Persistence?',
        answer: 'Agent State Persistence stores execution history, checkpoints, and accumulated metrics for each agent across sessions. This enables recovery from interruptions, performance tracking over time, and pattern learning. State is stored locally in JSON files under .attune/agents/state/.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is Dynamic Team Composition?',
        answer: 'Dynamic Team Composition allows you to build agent teams at runtime from 13 pre-built templates or custom configurations. Teams can execute with different strategies (parallel, sequential, two-phase, delegation) and enforce quality gates. You can also compose entire workflows into teams using the WorkflowComposer.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Licensing & Pricing',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How much does Attune AI cost?',
        answer: 'Attune AI is completely free and open source under the Apache License 2.0. Use it in personal projects, startups, or large enterprises at no cost. No license keys, no restrictions, no hidden fees.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is the Apache 2.0 License?',
        answer: 'Apache 2.0 is a permissive open source license approved by the OSI. It allows you to use, modify, distribute, and sell products built with Attune AI. It includes patent protection and is approved by most enterprise legal teams.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I use Attune AI for commercial projects?',
        answer: 'Yes! Apache 2.0 explicitly permits commercial use. Build and sell products using Attune AI without any licensing fees or restrictions.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Technical',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Which LLM providers are supported?',
        answer: 'Core workflows support multiple LLM providers including Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and local models via Ollama. Agent and team creation features (dynamic composition, SDK integration) work with the optional Anthropic Agent SDK for enhanced capabilities.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What are agent templates?',
        answer: 'Agent templates are pre-built agent archetypes with defined roles, capabilities, tier preferences, and quality gates. Attune AI includes 13 templates: security auditor, code reviewer, test coverage analyzer, documentation writer, performance optimizer, architecture analyst, refactoring specialist, dependency checker, bug predictor, release coordinator, integration tester, API designer, and DevOps engineer.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How is the framework tested?',
        answer: 'Attune AI has 7,400+ comprehensive tests covering unit tests, integration tests, and cross-platform compatibility. Core modules are rigorously tested for security, agent state persistence, dynamic team orchestration, workflow coordination, and meta-workflow functionality.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What platforms are supported?',
        answer: 'The framework is cross-platform and runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It requires Python 3.10+ and works with all major development environments including VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and terminal-based workflows.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Use Cases',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What can I build with Attune AI?',
        answer: 'You can build AI-powered developer workflows for software development (bug prediction, security scanning, test generation, code review), orchestrate multi-agent teams for complex analysis tasks, and compose workflows into coordinated pipelines. The framework also supports healthcare use cases with clinical decision support.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What happened to the Fair Source License?',
        answer: 'As of January 28, 2026, we switched from Fair Source 0.9 to Apache 2.0. We realized the licensing restrictions were limiting adoption without generating revenue. Going fully open source lets us focus on building the best framework and growing a community.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is the framework production-ready?',
        answer: 'Yes! The framework is v2.5.0 Production/Stable with 7,400+ comprehensive tests, extensive documentation, persistent agent state, dynamic team composition, and is being used in production software development tools and AI workflows.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Support & Community',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Where can I get help?',
        answer: 'Get community support via GitHub Discussions. Report bugs via GitHub Issues. Enterprise users can reach out for dedicated support options.',
