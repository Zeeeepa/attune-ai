# Cache Statistics and Performance Reporting - API Reference Documentation

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

**CacheAnalyzer** is a comprehensive cache performance analysis system that evaluates cache effectiveness and provides actionable recommendations for optimization. It works in conjunction with the `CacheMonitor` system to deliver insights into cache health, hit rates, and resource utilization.

#### What is CacheAnalyzer?

CacheAnalyzer analyzes cache performance metrics and translates raw statistics into meaningful health assessments. It evaluates:
- **Hit rate effectiveness** - How often cached data is successfully retrieved
- **Request patterns** - Volume and distribution of cache operations
- **Resource utilization** - Memory usage and capacity constraints
- **Confidence levels** - Statistical significance of the analysis

#### Key Benefits

1. **Performance Optimization** - Identify underperforming caches that waste resources
2. **Resource Efficiency** - Detect memory pressure and capacity issues before they impact performance
3. **Actionable Insights** - Receive specific recommendations tailored to each cache's behavior
4. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Make informed choices about cache configuration and strategy

#### When to Use This API

- **Monitoring Phase** - Regular health checks during production operation
- **Debugging Phase** - Investigate performance bottlenecks and cache misses
- **Optimization Phase** - Evaluate the impact of cache tuning and configuration changes
- **Capacity Planning** - Assess whether caches need resizing or restructuring

### 1.2 Quick Start

#### Installation Requirements

```python
# Required dependencies
from empathy_os.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer, CacheHealthScore
from empathy_os.cache_monitor import CacheMonitor
```

**Note:** Ensure `CacheMonitor` is properly initialized and tracking your caches before using `CacheAnalyzer`.

#### Basic Usage

```python
from empathy_os.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer

# Analyze a specific cache
health = CacheAnalyzer.analyze_cache("my_cache")

if health:
    print(f"Cache health: {health.health} ({health.hit_rate:.1%} hit rate)")
    print(f"Recommendation: {health.recommendation}")
else:
    print("Cache not found or insufficient data")
```

#### Minimal Working Example

```python
from empathy_os.cache_analyzer import CacheAnalyzer

# Single cache analysis
health = CacheAnalyzer.analyze_cache("ast_parse")
if health:
    print(f"Health: {health.health}, Hit Rate: {health.hit_rate:.1%}")
    print(f"Confidence: {health.confidence}")

# Analyze all caches
all_health = CacheAnalyzer.analyze_all()
for name, score in all_health.items():
    print(f"{name}: {score.health} (Hit Rate: {score.hit_rate:.1%})")
```

### 1.3 Core Concepts

#### Cache Health Scoring Methodology

CacheAnalyzer uses a multi-dimensional scoring system that considers:

1. **Hit Rate** - Primary indicator of cache effectiveness (0.0 to 1.0)
2. **Request Volume** - Number of total requests (affects confidence)
3. **Utilization** - Memory usage relative to capacity

**Health Categories:**
- **Excellent** - Cache is highly effective, delivering strong performance
- **Good** - Cache is working well with room for improvement
- **Fair** - Cache provides moderate benefit but may need attention
- **Poor** - Cache is ineffective and may be wasting resources

#### Confidence Levels and What They Mean

Confidence indicates the statistical reliability of the health assessment:

| Confidence | Request Count | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Low** | < 10 requests | Limited data; assessment may change significantly |
| **Medium** | 10-99 requests | Moderate data; trends are emerging |
| **High** | ≥ 100 requests | Strong data; assessment is reliable |

**Confidence-Adjusted Thresholds:**

```
Low Confidence (< 10 requests):
  - Excellent: ≥ 80% hit rate
  - Good: ≥ 60% hit rate
  - Fair: < 60% hit rate

Medium Confidence (10-99 requests):
  - Excellent: ≥ 70% hit rate
  - Good: ≥ 50% hit rate
  - Fair: ≥ 30% hit rate
  - Poor: < 30% hit rate

High Confidence (≥ 100 requests):
  - Excellent: ≥ 60% hit rate
  - Good: ≥ 40% hit rate
  - Fair: ≥ 20% hit rate
  - Poor: < 20% hit rate
```

**Important:** Lower confidence levels use stricter thresholds to avoid premature optimization based on insufficient data.

#### Hit Rate Interpretation

Hit rate is the ratio of cache hits to total requests:

```python
hit_rate = cache_hits / (cache_hits + cache_misses)
```

**Interpretation Guidelines:**

- **> 70%** - Strong performance; cache is well-suited to the access pattern
- **50-70%** - Moderate performance; consider optimization
- **20-50%** - Weak performance; review cache strategy
- **< 20%** - Poor performance; consider disabling or redesigning

#### Relationship to CacheMonitor and CacheStats

## API Reference

Complete structured reference for all public functions:

I notice you've provided a function with minimal documentation. Before I generate the API reference, let me ask a couple of clarifying questions to make this most helpful:

1. **What context is this for?** Is this for internal documentation, public API docs, or something else?
2. **What level of detail do you need?** Should I note what information is missing, or work only with what's provided?

However, I'll proceed with what's available. Here's the API reference based solely on the existing information:

---

## `to_dict`

Convert to dictionary.

### Signature

```python
def to_dict(self: Any) -> dict[str, Any]
```

### Parameters

- **self** (`Any`): The instance to convert.

### Returns

- `dict[str, Any]`: Dictionary representation of the object.

### Raises

*No exceptions documented.*

### Notes

- The docstring lacks detail about what keys/values the dictionary contains
- No information about the structure or schema of the returned dictionary
- No examples provided

---

**Documentation Quality Note:** This function would benefit from:
- Description of dictionary structure (keys and value types)
- Example usage
- Any exceptions that might be raised
- Whether nested objects are also converted to dictionaries

Would you like me to suggest a more complete docstring template for this function?
