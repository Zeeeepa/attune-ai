**Empathy Framework v4.4.0** is here with native agent orchestration designed specifically for Claude Code users.

## What's New in v4.4.0

### Native Composition Patterns

We've replaced external dependencies with 6 built-in composition patterns:

- **Sequential** - Tasks executed in order (A then B then C)
- **Parallel** - Independent tasks run simultaneously
- **Debate** - Multiple perspectives synthesized into consensus
- **Teaching** - Cost-effective generation with expert validation
- **Refinement** - Iterative improvement through draft/review cycles
- **Adaptive** - Smart routing based on task complexity

No CrewAI. No LangGraph. Just native Python patterns that work out of the box.

### 10 Smart Wizards

Production-ready wizards for software development:

| Wizard | Domain | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `security-audit` | Security | Vulnerability scanning, injection risks, compliance |
| `code-review` | Quality | Best practices, maintainability, bug detection |
| `bug-predict` | Debugging | Pattern-based bug prediction |
| `perf-audit` | Performance | Bottleneck identification, optimization |
| `refactor-plan` | Architecture | Safe refactoring strategies |
| `test-gen` | Testing | Test case generation, coverage improvement |
| `doc-gen` | Documentation | API docs, READMEs, guides |
| `dependency-check` | Dependencies | Vulnerability and license auditing |
| `release-prep` | Release | Pre-release quality gates |
| `research` | Research | Information synthesis |

### 14 Integrated Workflows

10 base workflows plus 4 new meta-workflows:

- **release-prep** - Automated release preparation with health checks
- **test-coverage-boost** - Intelligent test generation to hit coverage targets
- **test-maintenance** - Keep tests healthy and relevant
- **manage-docs** - Documentation quality management

## Claude Code Integration

**Agent and team creation features require Claude Code.** This includes:

- Socratic agent builder (guided agent creation)
- Dynamic agent composition
- Custom team orchestration
- Real-time agent spawning

Core workflows work with any provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama), but the agent creation magic requires Claude.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install
pip install empathy-framework

# Run a wizard
empathy workflow run security-audit

# Run with context
empathy workflow run test-gen --input '{"path": "./src"}'

# Check project health
empathy workflow run release-prep
```

## Why Native Patterns?

1. **Zero Dependencies** - No pip install of external frameworks
2. **Faster Startup** - No heavy framework initialization
3. **Better Debugging** - Clear Python stack traces
4. **Full Control** - Customize patterns without fighting abstractions

## Upgrade from v4.3

```bash
pip install --upgrade empathy-framework
```

If you were using CrewAI integration, see our [migration guide](/framework-docs/guides/CREWAI_MIGRATION/) for the native pattern equivalents.
