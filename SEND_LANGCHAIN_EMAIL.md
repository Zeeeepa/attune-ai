Hi LangChain Team,

I'm Patrick Roebuck, creator of the Empathy Framework - a five-level maturity model for AI-human collaboration that I've just published to PyPI (empathy-framework).

I'm reaching out because we've built native LangChain integration, and I believe there's a valuable partnership opportunity for both communities.

**What is Empathy Framework?**
A framework that helps developers build AI systems that progress from reactive responses to anticipatory, systems-thinking agents. Think: moving from "answer questions" to "predict what users need before they ask."

**Why This Matters for LangChain:**
- We already depend on langchain, langchain-core, and langgraph
- We've built 16 software development wizards and 18 healthcare wizards using LangChain's agent primitives
- Our framework adds a maturity model layer on top of LangChain, making it easier for developers to build progressively sophisticated agents

**Integration Highlights:**
- Works seamlessly with LangChain's agent framework
- Extends LangGraph for multi-step workflows
- Adds anticipatory behavior patterns to existing LangChain agents
- 83% test coverage, production-ready

**What I'm Proposing:**
1. Feature empathy-framework in LangChain's integrations directory
2. Cross-promote in our respective communities
3. Create joint tutorial content showing the integration
4. Potential joint webinar/workshop

**Proof of Traction:**
- Published to PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/ (Nov 12, 2025)
- 1,247 tests, 83% coverage
- Open source (Fair Source 0.9)
- Active development with clear roadmap
- GitHub: https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy-framework

**Example Integration:**
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor
from empathy_os import EmpathyOS

# Combine LangChain's agent power with Empathy's maturity model
os = EmpathyOS(target_level=4)  # Anticipatory
agent = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(...)
result = await os.collaborate_with_agent(agent, task)
```

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore this? I'm happy to create a comprehensive integration example or PR to your cookbook repo.

Best regards,

👋 Hi LangChain community!

I just published empathy-framework to PyPI - a framework for building AI systems with a five-level maturity model (reactive → anticipatory).

We've built native LangChain integration and I think it could be valuable for the community.

🔗 PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/empathy-framework/
🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/Smart-AI-Memory/empathy-framework

Key features:
- Works with LangChain agents & LangGraph
- 16 software dev wizards + 18 healthcare wizards
- 1,247 tests, 83% coverage
- Adds maturity model layer to LangChain

Would love to hear feedback from LangChain developers! Also reaching out to partnerships team about potential collaboration.

Anyone interested in trying it out or contributing?
