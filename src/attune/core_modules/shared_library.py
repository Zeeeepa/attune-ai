"""Shared Library Mixin for EmpathyOS.

Extracted from EmpathyOS to improve maintainability.
Provides async context manager support and shared pattern library methods
for multi-agent collaboration (Level 5 Systems Empathy).

Expected attributes on the host class:
    user_id (str): User identifier
    shared_library (PatternLibrary | None): Shared pattern library
    persistence_enabled (bool): Whether persistence is enabled
