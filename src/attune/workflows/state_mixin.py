"""State Persistence Mixin for BaseWorkflow.

Extracted as a mixin for maintainability.  Integrates
``AgentStateStore`` into the workflow execution loop to record
stage-level lifecycle events and save checkpoints for recovery.

When ``self._state_store`` is ``None`` every method is a no-op,
making the mixin completely backwards-compatible.

Expected attributes on the host class:
    name (str): Workflow name
    _state_store (AgentStateStore | None): State store instance
    _agent_id (str | None): Agent identifier (set during execute())
    _run_id (str): Execution run ID (set during execute())
