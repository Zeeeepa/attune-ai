Replaces mixin inheritance with explicit service composition. Workflows can
declare only the capabilities they need by populating the relevant service
slots on WorkflowContext.

    Each slot is optional -- workflows only populate the services they need.
    When attached to a BaseWorkflow via the ``ctx`` parameter, proxy methods
    delegate to the service when available and fall back to mixin behavior
    when the service is ``None``.

        cache: Response caching service
        cost: Cost calculation and reporting service
        telemetry: Telemetry tracking service
        prompt: Prompt building and rendering service
        parsing: Response parsing and finding extraction service
        tier: Model tier routing service
        coordination: Inter-agent coordination service

    Example:
        >>> from attune.workflows.context import WorkflowContext
        >>> from attune.workflows.services import CacheService, CostService
